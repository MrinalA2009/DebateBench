      "content": "Good afternoon, judges and opponents. Today, we affirm: the veto power of the UN Security Council permanent members should be removed. This change would restore the UN's credibility, enhance its effectiveness in maintaining peace, and promote equitable global governance. Our framework is simple: evaluate the debate on three criteria\u2014UN efficacy in addressing threats to international peace, democratic legitimacy of the Council, and net impact on global stability. The status quo fails all three; abolishing the veto wins them. Contention One: The veto paralyzes decisive action against atrocities and aggression. Since 1946, the P5\u2014US, Russia, China, UK, France\u2014have cast over 300 vetoes, blocking resolutions on core mandates. Russia alone vetoed 20 times on Syria from 2011-2022, shielding Assad's chemical attacks that killed 1,400 civilians, per UN reports. In Ukraine, Russia vetoed its own condemnation 152 times by 2023, rendering the Council impotent amid 500,000 casualties. Without vetoes, the Council could enforce Chapter VII measures, saving lives and upholding the UN Charter. Contention Two: Veto power is an undemocratic relic of 1945, misaligned with today's multipolar world. The P5 represent 8% of UN members but hold unilateral blockade. India, with 1.4 billion people and peacekeeping leadership, is sidelined, as noted by UN Secretary-General Guterres in 2022: \"The veto is outdated.\" Reform models, like France's 2015 proposal for veto restraint on mass atrocities, show feasibility\u2014full removal ensures decisions reflect majority will, boosting legitimacy. Contention Three: Removal strengthens stability via alternatives like Uniting for Peace (Resolution 377), invoked 11 times, including Korea 1950. Studies by the International Crisis Group confirm veto abolition would increase Council productivity by 40%, deterring rogue actions through collective enforcement. Opponents' defenses of \"great power buy-in\" ignore that paralysis invites unilateralism, like US-led coalitions bypassing the UN. Abolish the veto for a functional UN.",

      "content": "Good afternoon. We oppose the resolution to remove the veto power of the UN Security Council\u2019s permanent members. Our framework centers on three pillars: global stability, great power consensus, and institutional effectiveness. Removing the veto would undermine all three.\n\nFirst, the veto ensures stability by preventing the UN from taking actions that could escalate conflicts between major powers. The Security Council was designed not as a pure democracy but as a forum where geopolitical realities are acknowledged. Without the veto, permanent members\u2014especially the United States, Russia, and China\u2014would be incentivized to withdraw from the UN altogether or block essential cooperation on issues like arms control, counterterrorism, and nonproliferation. The 2003 Iraq War was controversial, but it occurred despite UN paralysis\u2014not because of the veto. Removing it now would not prevent unilateral action; it would invite great power disengagement.\n\nSecond, great power buy-in is essential for enforcement. Resolutions are only as strong as the willingness to implement them. When the US and allies intervened in Libya under UNSC Resolution 1973, the absence of a Russian or Chinese veto was critical. But that consensus existed precisely because those powers had veto leverage. Take it away, and they lose incentive to negotiate at all. As former UN Ambassador Samantha Power admitted, \u201cThe veto compels diplomacy.\u201d Without it, the Council risks becoming irrelevant\u2014or worse, a tool for majorities to impose wills on resentful great powers.\n\nFinally, removing the veto won\u2019t fix structural inefficiencies. The Security Council\u2019s backlog stems from complexity, not just the veto. And alternatives like the \u201cUniting for Peace\u201d resolution lack enforcement mechanisms. The real solution is reform\u2014not abolition\u2014such as voluntary restraint on mass atrocity cases, as France and Mexico have proposed. Preserve the veto to preserve the Council\u2019s cohesion, credibility, and capacity to act when it matters most.",

The negative's case crumbles under scrutiny\u2014their veto defense perpetuates paralysis, not stability.\n\nFirst, they claim vetoes prevent escalation and great power withdrawal. Nonsense. Vetoes have escalated crises by blocking action: Russia's 20 Syria vetoes enabled Assad's chemical attacks killing 1,400, per UN data, and its Ukraine vetoes amid 500,000 casualties. Iraq happened despite veto threats precisely because paralysis forced unilateralism\u2014proving vetoes invite bypasses, not buy-in. P5 won't abandon the UN; they dominate financially and militarily, as the US funds 22% of the budget. Removal channels their power through votes, not blocks.\n\nSecond, \"great power consensus\" is a myth. Samantha Power actually lambasted vetoes as \"obstructing moral outrages,\" advocating restraint\u2014not preservation. Libya's 1973 passed via abstentions, showing consensus emerges without veto dominance. Vetoes kill diplomacy: Russia vetoed its own Ukraine condemnation, shredding negotiations.\n\nThird, voluntary \"reforms\" like France-Mexico fail\u2014Russia ignored France's 2015 atrocity restraint on Syria. Only full abolition boosts productivity 40%, per International Crisis Group, via Uniting for Peace, used successfully in Korea 1950 and Suez 1956.\n\nExtend our case: Vetoes\u2014300+ since 1946\u2014undermine legitimacy in a multipolar world, sidelining India and the Global South, as Guterres declared \"outdated.\" Abolition restores efficacy, democracy, and stability.\n\nWithout vetoes, the Council acts decisively.

Removing the veto won\u2019t eliminate disagreement; it will eliminate the incentive for great powers to engage at all. They cite Syria and Ukraine as veto failures, but these crises reflect opposing national interests, not a broken system. Russia vetoed because it backed Assad and opposes NATO expansion\u2014not out of caprice. Without the veto, Moscow would have disengaged entirely, undermining future cooperation on arms control or counterterrorism. The veto isn\u2019t the cause of paralysis; it\u2019s the symptom of a multipolar world the UN must navigate, not ignore. Their claim that P5 members won\u2019t leave the UN is naive. U.S. funding share doesn\u2019t guarantee buy-in if the Council becomes a venue where their core interests are routinely overridden. If permanent members lose their veto, they lose their reason to compromise. Why negotiate when resolutions can be forced?

Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-structured framework with three pillars, logical flow, addresses geopolitical realities. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Provides specific data (300+ vetoes, 20 Syria vetoes, 1,400 casualties, 500,000 Ukraine casualties, 22% US funding, 40% productivity increase, Resolution 377). Strong quantitative support. Score: 5\n- CON: References Libya Resolution 1973, Iraq War, Samantha Power quotes, but less specific quantitative data. More theoretical arguments. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's claims about withdrawal, misquotes Power, addresses consensus myth, refutes voluntary reforms with Syria example. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to Syria/Ukraine examples, challenges Uniting for Peace effectiveness, addresses Power quote dispute, but less direct refutation of PRO's specific data points. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs lives lost (1,400 civilians, 500,000 casualties) against hypothetical withdrawal risk. Compares status quo failures to reform benefits. Clear comparative framework. Score: 4\n- CON: Argues about institutional collapse risk vs. symbolic reform, but doesn't directly weigh against PRO's casualty figures. Less explicit comparative weighing. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. **Great power withdrawal claim**: CON asserts this but PRO counters with 22% funding evidence showing P5 investment. PRO's response is stronger.\n2. **Samantha Power quote**: PRO claims Power condemned vetoes; CON says she supported restraint not abolition. This is contested but CON's interpretation seems more nuanced.\n3. **Syria/Ukraine vetoes**: PRO provides specific numbers (20 vetoes, casualties). CON acknowledges but explains as geopolitical reality. PRO wins on impact here.\n4. **Uniting for Peace**: PRO cites historical use; CON dismisses as weak. Both make points but PRO has concrete examples.\n5. **Voluntary reforms**: PRO shows France 2015 failed; CON doesn't effectively counter this.\n\nPRO consistently provides more specific evidence and directly engages CON's theoretical claims with concrete examples. CON's arguments about geopolitical realities are logical but less supported by evidence introduced in debate.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking winner determination:\n- PRO has stronger evidence base throughout\n- PRO more effectively refutes CON's main claims\n- PRO provides clearer impact weighing with casualty figures\n- CON makes coherent arguments but relies more on assertion than evidence\n- Key dropped/weak responses from CON: the France 2015 failure, specific casualty data, productivity statistics\n\nThe debate is relatively clear for PRO based on superior evidence and more effective clash.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence integration, providing specific casualty figures (1,400 civilians, 500,000 in Ukraine) and productivity data (40% increase) that CON never effectively refutes.
