      "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, today we affirm the resolution that social media does more harm than good. Our argument is structured around three key claims: mental health impact, misinformation proliferati on, and erosion of real-life social skills. Firstly, let\u2019s consider the impact of social media on mental health. Numerous studies, including one from the Pew Research Center, indicate that excessive social media use is linked to increased anxiety, depressi on, and feelings of isolati on, particularly among adolescents. The constant comparison to curated online personas can lead to a distorted self-image and exacerbate feelings of inadequacy. Secondly, social media serves as a breeding ground for misinformati on. The rapid spread of false information can have dire consequences, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, where misleading claims about treatments and vaccines proliferated online, leading to public health risks. According to a study published in the journal \"Science,\" misinformation spreads six times faster than factual information on platforms like Twitter. This undermines informed decisi on-making and creates societal divisi on. Lastly, social media contributes to the erosion of real-life social skills. With the prevalence of online interactions, individuals, especially younger generations, are losing the ability to communicate effectively face-to-face. A study by the University of California found that adolescents who spend more time on social media report feeling less capable of initiating conversations and forming meaningful relationships in pers on. In summary, the mental health crises, the rampant misinformati on, and the degradation of social skills illustrate that social media does indeed do more harm than good. We must prioritize genuine human connection and accurate information over the fleeting benefits of online engagement. Thank you.",

      "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, we stand in firm opposition to today's resoluti on. While my opponents highlight concerns, they fundamentally misunderstand social media's transformative benefits for society. Our framework is simple: evaluate social media by its net impact on human connecti on, access to informati on, and societal progress. When measured fairly, social media clearly does more good than harm. First, social media revolutionizes global connectivity. Over 4.9 billion people worldwide use these platforms to maintain relationships across distances, find communities of shared interest, and combat isolati on. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media became a lifeline for millions, enabling virtual gatherings, remote work, and emotional support when physical connection was impossible. My opponents cite mental health concerns, but correlation isn't causati on\u2014underlying issues often drive social media use, not vice versa. Second, social media democratizes information and amplifies marginalized voices. Movements like Me Too and Black Lives Matter gained momentum through social media, creating accountability and driving social change. Citizens in authoritarian regimes use these platforms to organize, share truth, and connect with the outside world. Yes, misinformation exists, but social media also enables rapid fact-checking and diverse perspectives that traditional media cannot provide. Third, social media drives economic opportunity and educati on. Small businesses reach global markets, creators build careers, and free educational content reaches underserved communities. According to Deloitte, social media contributes over 200 billion dollars annually to the U.S. economy alone. My opponents cherry-pick negative studies while ignoring context. Any tool can be misused\u2014cars cause accidents, but we d on't ban transportati on. The solution is digital literacy and responsible use, not condemning platforms that connect billions, democratize informati on, and create unprecedented opportunities. Social media empowers humanity. We urge you to vote C on.",

      "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, while my opponents argue that social media fosters connectivity and empowerment, they overlook the severe consequences it imposes on mental health, the spread of misinformati on, and real-life social skills. Firstly, regarding mental health, it is crucial to recognize that correlation can indeed imply causati on. The Pew Research Center's findings demonstrate that excessive social media use is a significant factor contributing to anxiety and depressi on, particularly among adolescents. It\u2019s not merely underlying issues that drive social media use; the environments created by these platforms exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and isolati on. Secondly, while my opponents mention the democratization of informati on, they ignore the alarming reality that misinformation can have deadly consequences. The same platforms that amplify marginalized voices have also allowed harmful misinformation to thrive, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The \u201cScience\u201d study they dismiss highlights that misinformation spreads six times faster than factual informati on, creating confusion and mistrust in essential health communications. Finally, while social media may offer opportunities for economic growth, it simultaneously erodes real-life social skills. My opponents fail to address the studies showing that adolescents struggle with face-to-face communication due to their reliance on digital interactions. In conclusi on, while social media has its benefits, the overwhelming evidence suggests that it does more harm than good. We must protect our mental health, ensure accurate information disseminati on, and nurture our interpersonal skills. Thank you.",

      "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, my opponents continue to misrepresent the evidence and ignore the broader context. First, on mental health: they claim correlation implies causati on, but that's scientifically irresponsible. The American Psychological Association notes that vulnerable individuals seek online support, meaning pre-existing conditions often precede social media use. Furthermore, platforms now implement mental health resources and screen time tools. The solution is better platform design, not eliminating tools that provide crucial support networks for isolated individuals. Second, regarding misinformati on: my opponents ignore that traditional media has always spread false informati on\u2014remember weapons of mass destruction claims? Social media actually enables faster corrections through community notes, fact-checkers, and diverse voices challenging falsehoods. The COVID-19 example cuts both ways: these same platforms distributed accurate health information from WHO and CDC to billions instantly, something impossible before. Third, they dismiss economic benefits while providing no evidence that digital communication inherently destroys social skills. Generation Z, raised on social media, demonstrates strong collaborative abilities and global awareness. The University of California study they cite conflates correlation with causati on\u2014the same logical fallacy they accuse us of avoiding. My opponents want you to focus on problems while ignoring solutions and benefits. Yes, challenges exist, but we address them through digital literacy education and platform accountability, not by rejecting technology connecting 4.9 billion people. The resolution asks about net impact. Social media enables unprecedented human connecti on, democratizes informati on, and creates economic opportunity.
