As the affirmative, we prove that banning all military activities in outer space maximizes global security, sustainability, and human progress.\n\nOur framework: Judge this debate on net benefits to humanity. Militarization risks catastrophic conflict and debris; demilitarization fosters cooperation and exploration. Voting affirmative prevents these harms while upholding the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which already prohibits nuclear weapons but needs strengthening against conventional arms.\n\nContention One: Demilitarization prevents an escalatory arms race. Space is the ultimate high ground\u2014control it, and you dominate Earth. The U.S. Space Force's 2024 budget exceeds $30 billion, fueling anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons. China's 2007 ASAT test destroyed a satellite, creating 3,000 trackable debris pieces; Russia's 2021 test added 1,500 more. John Hyten, former U.S. Strategic Command head, warned in 2018 that space weaponization invites \"Pearl Harbor in space.\" Demilitarization via a binding UN treaty extension halts this spiral, reducing miscalculation risks in crises like Ukraine.\n\nContention Two: It ensures orbital sustainability. Militarization generates Kessler Syndrome\u2014a chain reaction of debris rendering orbits unusable. NASA's 2023 models show 60,000+ debris objects already threaten the $500 billion satellite economy, including GPS and communications vital to 8 billion people. The Secure World Foundation reports ASAT tests as the top debris source. Demilitarizing bans tests, preserving space for science\u2014Artemis missions, Starlink internet, climate monitoring.\n\nContention Three: Economic and ethical gains. Redirecting $30 billion annually funds exploration; the Mars Society estimates demilitarized space doubles private investment.\n\nIn summary, affirmative secures peace, cleans orbits, and unlocks progress.

The affirmative's framework, focusing solely on net benefits to humanity, is overly simplistic and ignores the complexities of international relations and security dynamics.\n\nFirstly, demilitarization would create a power vacuum, allowing hostile nations to exploit the lack of military presence in space. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 already prohibits nuclear weapons, but it does not account for the rapid advancement of conventional space-based technologies. Without a military presence, the United States and its allies would be vulnerable to attacks on their space-based assets, which are critical to national security and global communication systems.\n\nFurthermore, the affirmative's contention that demilitarization prevents an escalatory arms race is misguided. The development of space-based military capabilities is a natural response to the militarization of space by other nations, such as China and Russia. The United States has a responsibility to protect its interests and assets in space, and demilitarization would undermine this ability.\n\nAdditionally, the economic and ethical gains proposed by the affirmative are overstated. While redirecting funds from military space programs to exploration and development may seem appealing, it ignores the significant economic benefits of a strong space-based military, including the creation of jobs and the stimulation of innovation. In conclusion, the negative firmly believes that space should not be demilitarized, as it would compromise national security, create a power vacuum, and undermine the economic benefits of a strong space-based military.",

History proves this works: the 1967 OST has prevented nukes in space for 57 years despite tensions.

They claim that demilitarization isn't unilateral disarmament, but rather a binding UN treaty. However, the reality is that not all nations will adhere to such a treaty, and the absence of a robust enforcement mechanism makes it ineffective. The affirmative cites the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 as a success story, but this treaty has significant limitations. It only prohibits nuclear weapons, and its language is ambiguous, allowing for the development of conventional space-based technologies. Furthermore, the treaty has not prevented the development of ASAT capabilities, as evidenced by China's 2007 test and Russia's 2021 test. The affirmative also downplays the importance of a strong space-based military, claiming that it crowds out innovation. However, this ignores the fact that military research and development have driven many technological advancements that have benefited society as a whole. The affirmative's proposal to redirect funds from military space programs to exploration and development is overly simplistic and ignores the complexities of the space industry. In conclusion, the affirmative's case relies on unrealistic assumptions about international cooperation and the effectiveness of treaties.
