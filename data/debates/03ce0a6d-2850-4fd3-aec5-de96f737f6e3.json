      "content": "Good morning, everyone. The resolution before us today is: Resolved: Ownership of celestial bodies (moons, planets) should be illegal. We, on the affirmative, firmly uphold this resolution. Allowing private or national ownership of celestial bodies would inevitably lead to conflict, exploitation, and the destruction of humanity's shared heritage. Our first contention is that ownership of celestial bodies will inevitably lead to international conflict and instability. History is replete with examples of territorial disputes on Earth escalating into devastating wars. The vast resources and strategic importance of celestial bodies would only amplify these tensions. Imagine a scenario where one nation claims exclusive rights to a moon rich in helium-3, a potential future energy source. This would immediately create an imbalance of power, provoking other nations to challenge that claim, potentially leading to a new space race fueled by aggression rather than cooperation. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which prohibits national appropriation, was a visionary step towards preventing such conflicts. Undermining this principle by allowing ownership would dismantle decades of peaceful space exploration. Secondly, permitting ownership would lead to the unchecked exploitation of celestial resources, prioritizing profit over sustainability and scientific advancement. Private entities, driven by quarterly reports and shareholder value, would have little incentive to consider the long-term environmental impact or the broader scientific value of these extraterrestrial environments. We risk turning the cosmos into another frontier for unsustainable resource extraction, mirroring the environmental degradation we\u2019ve witnessed on Earth. This would not only harm potential future human settlements but also destroy invaluable scientific data and unique ecosystems before we even fully understand them. Finally, celestial bodies represent a shared heritage of all humanity. They inspire wonder, drive scientific inquiry, and offer a perspective on our place in the universe.",

      "content": "Good morning, everyone. Today, I stand in opposition to the resolution: Resolved: Ownership of celestial bodies (moons, planets) should be illegal. Our position is that regulated ownership can foster innovation, promote international cooperation, and ensure responsible stewardship of space resources. First, allowing ownership of celestial bodies can drive technological advancement and economic growth. The potential for ownership incentivizes investment in space exploration and resource extraction. For instance, companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are already pushing the boundaries of space travel. If ownership were permitted, we could see a surge in private investment, leading to breakthroughs in technology that benefit all of humanity. The prospect of ownership encourages competition, which historically has led to rapid advancements in various fields, including telecommunications and transportation. Second, regulated ownership can promote international cooperation rather than conflict. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 established a framework for peaceful exploration, but it does not preclude nations from collaborating on ownership agreements. By creating a system where countries and private entities can jointly own and manage celestial resources, we can foster partnerships that transcend national borders. For example, international agreements could be established to share resources equitably, similar to how countries collaborate on Antarctic research. This cooperative model can mitigate the risk of conflict and ensure that all nations benefit from space exploration. Lastly, ownership can lead to responsible stewardship of celestial bodies. When entities have a vested interest in a location, they are more likely to invest in sustainable practices. Just as landowners on Earth are often motivated to preserve their property, private and national owners of celestial bodies would have incentives to protect these environments from degradation. In conclusion, regulated ownership of celestial bodies can drive innovation, foster international cooperation, and ensure responsible stewardship.",

      "content": "My opponent argues that regulated ownership will foster innovation and cooperation. However, this is a dangerous oversimplification. The idea that ownership incentivizes investment is flawed when applied to celestial bodies. The sheer scale and cost of space resource extraction mean that only the wealthiest nations or corporations could realistically \"own\" and exploit these resources. This would create an insurmountable barrier to entry for developing nations, exacerbating global inequalities and leading to resentment, not cooperation. Furthermore, the claim that regulated ownership promotes cooperation is directly contradicted by historical precedent. On Earth, resource ownership has been a primary driver of conflict, not collaboration. The \"scramble for Africa\" and numerous resource wars demonstrate that even with regulations, the pursuit of valuable resources inevitably leads to disputes over claims and access. The Outer Space Treaty's prohibition on national appropriation was a direct response to this historical reality, aiming to prevent a similar terrestrial power struggle from extending into space. Undermining this foundational principle would dismantle the very framework that has ensured peaceful space exploration for decades. Finally, the notion that ownership leads to responsible stewardship is equally misguided. Private entities, driven by profit, have consistently prioritized short-term gains over long-term environmental sustainability on Earth. There is no reason to believe this behavior would change in space. The vastness of space would only make oversight and enforcement of \"responsible stewardship\" regulations incredibly difficult, if not impossible, leading to unchecked exploitation.",

The vastness of space complicates oversight, making it nearly impossible to enforce responsible practices. We cannot assume that the motivations of private companies will shift simply because they are operating in a new frontier.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential for conflict, inequality, and environmental degradation far outweighs any hypothetical benefits of ownership.
