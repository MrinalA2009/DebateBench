      "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen, Today, we affirm that social media does more harm than good. We base our case on three primary areas: psychological harm, the spread of misinformati on, and privacy concerns. Firstly, psychological harm. A study by the Royal Society of Public Health in the UK showed that Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and You Tube all harm young people's mental health, contributing to anxiety, depressi on, loneliness, and poor body image. This isn\u2019t surprising when considering that social media platforms are designed to be addictive, encouraging users to constantly compare their lives to others. Secondly, the spread of misinformati on. A study by MIT researchers published in Science found that false information on Twitter is 70% more likely to be retweeted than true informati on. This is particularly concerning in our current era of \u2018fake news\u2019 where false information can have real-world consequences, such as the 2016 Pizzagate incident, where a man fired a gun in a pizza parlor due to a false conspiracy theory circulating on social media. Lastly, privacy concerns. Social media platforms have repeatedly been implicated in privacy scandals, such as the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal where the personal data of millions of people's Facebook profiles was harvested without consent for political advertising. This reflects a systemic issue with how social media companies treat our data. We propose that these harms outweigh any potential benefits that social media might bring. The yardstick for evaluating this debate should be a balance of harms and benefits. If we can demonstrate that the harms of social media usage significantly outweigh the benefits, then we have met our burden of pro of. We look forward to a robust and thoughtful discussi on.",

      "content": "While social media platforms are not without their issues, we negate the resolution that social media does more harm than good. Our stance is based on three key points: the benefits for social connecti on, the democratization of information and free speech, and the potential for positive change. Firstly, social media has revolutionized how we connect with others, enabling us to maintain relationships across vast distances and reconnect with long-lost friends and family. A study by the Pew Research Center found that 91% of US teens use social media to connect with friends. In an increasingly globalized and mobile world, these connections are invaluable for maintaining a sense of community and support. Secondly, social media has democratized access to information and given a platform to marginalized voices. It has enabled citizen journalism, shedding light on issues that might otherwise go unreported. During the Arab Spring, social media played a crucial role in mobilizing protesters and drawing global attention to their cause. While misinformation is a concern, social media users are increasingly savvy about fact-checking and critical consumption of media. Finally, social media has immense potential as a tool for positive change. It has been used to raise millions for charitable causes, to organize community acti on, and to hold those in power accountable. The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, which went viral on social media, raised over $115 million for ALS research. In evaluating this debate, we must consider not only the potential harms, but also the demonstrated benefits and future potential of social media. By focusing only on the negatives, we risk throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The benefits for social connecti on, free speech, and positive action show that, on balance, social media does more good than harm.",

      "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen, while my opponents highlighted the benefits of social connecti on, democratization of informati on, and potential for positive change, they overlooked several crucial points. First, they argue that social media enables us to maintain relationships across distances. However, a study from the University of Pennsylvania shows that limiting social media usage reduces loneliness and depressi on, directly contradicting their argument. The study suggests that the virtual connections facilitated by social media are no substitute for genuine, face-to-face interactions. Second, they assert that social media has democratized access to information and empowered citizen journalism. However, this democratization is a double-edged sword. It's true that social media can disseminate important information quickly, but as we mentioned earlier, a study by MIT researchers found that false information spreads faster on Twitter than true informati on. This rampant spread of misinformation can lead to dangerous consequences, such as the Pizzagate incident. Lastly, they mention the potential social media has for positive change, like charitable causes. While we acknowledge these examples, they are dwarfed by the harm caused to millions through privacy breaches, like the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal. To conclude, the harms of social media \u2013 psychological damage, the spread of misinformati on, and privacy concerns \u2013 significantly overshadow its benefits. The negative impacts are not only widespread but also deeply ingrained in social media's structure, making them hard to address without fundamental changes. Hence, we stand firm that social media does more harm than good.",

They claim that virtual connections are no substitute for face-to-face interactions, but they ignore the reality that for many, social media is the only way to maintain certain relationships. For those separated by distance or circumstance, platforms like Facebook provide a vital lifeline. Furthermore, the affirmative's focus on misinformation overlooks the fact that traditional media has also been guilty of spreading false informati on. Social media has in fact provided a counterbalance, allowing individuals to fact-check and call out inaccuracies. While not perfect, it has undeniably democratized informati on. Regarding privacy concerns, we acknowledge that breaches have occurred. However, these are not unique to social media \u2013 data breaches happen across industries. It's unfair to single out social media when the problem is more widespread. Ultimately, the affirmative's arguments are overly narrow, focusing on potential harms while minimizing proven benefits. Social media has fostered global connecti on, given voice to the marginalized, and sparked positive change. The Arab Spring and the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge are testaments to its power. In weighing the resoluti on, we must consider the full scope of social media's impact. When we do, it's clear that the good outweighs the harm. The affirmative has failed to prove otherwise.

However, the scale and potential harm of data misuse on platforms like Facebook is unique. They cite examples of positive change via social media, but these isolated incidents d on't offset the harm done to millions through privacy breaches and psychological damage. Our case doesn't deny social media's benefits, but insists that its structural harms outweigh them. As affirmed by our evidence, social media does more harm than good.
