Because they remove pilots from the battlefield, nations face fewer political and emotional costs when launching attacks. This encourages military action without proper justification or public scrutiny. A 2013 study by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths\u2014many of them children\u2014often based on faulty intelligence. When lethal force is conducted remotely, the psychological weight of killing diminishes, increasing the likelihood of reckless or unethical operations.\n\nSecond, drone warfare routinely violates the principles of distinction and proportionality under international humanitarian law. These principles require combatants to distinguish between civilians and soldiers and to avoid excessive civilian harm relative to military gain. Drones, particularly in covert programs, operate with little transparency or accountability. The United Nations has repeatedly raised concerns about extrajudicial killings conducted via drones, calling into question their legality.\n\nFinally, normalizing drone warfare sets a dangerous precedent. If powerful nations use drones to carry out targeted killings without consent or oversight, weaker states and non-state actors will inevitably follow suit. This arms race in remote warfare threatens global stability and increases the risk of unintended escalation.\n\nWe must uphold the value of human life and the rule of law. Banning drones in warfare is a necessary step to prevent abuse, protect civilians, and preserve international norms. The ease of pressing a button must never outweigh the gravity of taking a life.",

      "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the resolution demands a total ban on drones in warfare, but this is shortsighted and dangerous. As the negative, we prove drones are indispensable tools that save lives, enhance precision, and strengthen national security. Our framework: evaluate the debate on net human impact\u2014civilian and combatant lives saved, military effectiveness, and global stability. Banning drones forces reliance on deadlier alternatives like ground invasions or carpet bombing, increasing overall harm. Contention 1: Drones protect soldiers and civilians by minimizing risk. Unlike manned aircraft, drones eliminate pilot endangerment, allowing persistent surveillance and precise strikes. A 2018 RAND Corporation study found U.S. drone operations in Afghanistan reduced coalition casualties by 90% compared to manned missions, while enabling 10 times more intelligence-driven strikes. Without pilots in harm's way, commanders avoid escalatory full-scale invasions\u2014precisely countering the affirmative's \"lowered threshold\" claim. Drones enable surgical responses to threats like ISIS, preventing broader wars. Contention 2: Drones uphold, rather than violate, international humanitarian law through superior distinction and proportionality. Equipped with advanced sensors, drones loiter for hours, verifying targets far better than fast-moving jets or artillery. A 2020 Air Force report showed drone strikes had a 90% combatant kill rate in Iraq and Syria, versus 50-60% for manned airstrikes. The UN's own 2013 report by Ben Emmerson noted drones can comply with IHL when used transparently\u2014issues stem from policy, not technology. Banning them ignores this, reverting to indiscriminate methods that killed far more civilians in Vietnam or WWII. Contention 3: Drones deter proliferation and escalation. They allow targeted counterterrorism without boots on the ground, as in Yemen, where strikes degraded al-Qaeda without U.S. occupation. The affirmative's \"arms race\" fear is baseless\u2014states already pursue drones; banning them for democracies hands the edge to adversaries like China or Russia.",

Yes, drones may reduce risk to pilots, but that very advantage lowers the threshold for war, making lethal force too convenient and frequent. The RAND study they cite ignores the broader consequences: drone strikes fuel extremism. A 2012 study by the New America Foundation found that for every high-value target killed, multiple civilian deaths sparked local outrage, increasing recruitment for groups like the Taliban. Reducing American casualties at the cost of radicalizing entire communities is not a net benefit\u2014it\u2019s a strategic failure. On humanitarian law, the negative wrongly claims drones enhance distinction. But prolonged surveillance does not guarantee accuracy. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism documented that between 2004 and 2020, U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan killed nearly 500 civilians, including over 200 children\u2014many in so-called \"signature strikes\" targeting unknown males in military-aged groups. That\u2019s not precision; it\u2019s profiling. The Air Force report they cite is internally inconsistent\u2014how can 90% of those killed be combatants when ground reports reveal funerals and weddings turned into massacre sites? And let\u2019s be clear: transparency is not the problem\u2014drones themselves are. Even if used \"properly,\" their covert nature enables extrajudicial killings without due process. The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions has repeatedly condemned drone strikes as violations of sovereignty and human rights. Finally, the arms race is already here\u2014precisely because major powers normalize drone warfare. Banning drones stops the cycle before swarms and AI-controlled weapons make conflict unstoppable.",
