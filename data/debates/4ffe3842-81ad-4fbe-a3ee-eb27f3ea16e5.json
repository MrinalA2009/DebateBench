      "content": "The United Nations Security Council was designed to maintain international peace and security, yet its most powerful members routinely undermine that mission through the veto. Today, we affirm the resolution: the veto power of the UN Security Council permanent members should be removed. Our framework is clear\u2014effectiveness, accountability, and moral legitimacy. When a tool consistently fails to uphold these principles, it must be reformed.\n\nFirst, the veto cripples the UN\u2019s effectiveness. When mass atrocities occur, the Council often stands paralyzed. Consider Syria: over 600,000 dead, 12 million displaced, and yet Russia cast 15 vetoes blocking humanitarian and accountability measures. China and Russia have repeatedly shielded regimes committing war crimes. A body meant to act decisively is reduced to inaction by the self-interest of five nations.\n\nSecond, the veto violates democratic accountability. The five permanent members\u2014chosen in 1945\u2014no longer reflect global power or moral leadership. India, Japan, Germany, and Brazil, among others, contribute significantly to peacekeeping and global stability, yet have no permanent voice. Meanwhile, the U.S., UK, France, Russia, and China can unilaterally override collective will. This is not governance\u2014it is privilege disguised as authority.\n\nFinally, the veto erodes the UN\u2019s moral legitimacy. When Russia vetoes resolutions condemning its own invasion of Ukraine, or when the U.S. blocks actions on Israel-Palestine, it signals that power, not principle, rules. The UN risks becoming irrelevant if it cannot act against aggression by its most powerful members.\n\nRemoving the veto would not eliminate great power influence, but it would ensure that influence is exercised through debate and consensus, not unilateral obstruction. A reformed Security Council can better fulfill its founding promise: a world where peace is upheld not by privilege, but by principle.",

      "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the resolution to abolish the UN Security Council veto ignores the harsh realities of international relations. As the Negative, we offer a realist framework: evaluate the debate based on the UN Charter's core mission\u2014maintaining international peace and security. Does removing the veto enhance or undermine this? History and logic prove it destroys the Council's legitimacy and functionality.\n\nContention One: The veto ensures great power consensus, without which the UN collapses into irrelevance. Post-World War II, the P5\u2014victors who could have ignored the UN\u2014demanded veto power at Dumbarton Oaks to guarantee buy-in. When consensus exists, the Council acts decisively: 1950 Korean War (Soviet abstention enabled action), 1991 Gulf War (unanimous). Absent veto, P5 simply bypass the UN, as NATO did in Kosovo (1999) or Russia in Georgia (2008). The Pro's Syria example? Vetoes prevented Libya-style interventions that fueled chaos\u2014over 50,000 Libyan deaths post-Gaddafi. Inaction beats escalation to world war.\n\nContention Two: Abolishing the veto triggers P5 disengagement, dooming global stability. The U.S. Senate ratified the UN Charter explicitly contingent on veto preservation (Senator Vandenberg). Today, U.S. law (UN Participation Act) requires veto protection. Russia and China have warned repeatedly: no veto, no participation. The Pro's call for \"India, Japan\" ignores that reform requires P5 consent\u2014Article 108 demands it. Their \"democratic accountability\" fantasy clashes with realism: the UN isn't a democracy; it's a concert of powers. Vetoes number just 293 since 1946, mostly abstentions now, enabling 2,700+ resolutions.\n\nContention Three: Veto upholds moral legitimacy by preventing hypocritical crusades. Pro cites Russia-Ukraine and U.S.-Israel vetoes, but without veto, futile anti-P5 resolutions erode trust faster. The Council thrives on compromise, not Pro's utopian consensus.\n\nVote Negative: Preserve the veto to safeguard peace through power balance, not perilous reform. Thank you.",

The veto doesn\u2019t prevent chaos; it invites it by signaling impunity. On functionality, the Negative argues P5 withdrawal would follow reform. But threatening to leave the UN undermines their own argument: if the P5 value the institution only when they can control it unilaterally, then the Council serves their interests, not global peace. The UN\u2019s legitimacy comes from moral authority, not mere survival. Letting powerful states hold the organization hostage degrades its purpose. And let\u2019s be clear\u2014Article 108 allows charter amendment, but it doesn\u2019t make reform impossible. It demands dialogue, not surrender to autocrats.

Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Strong realist framework with clear contentions. Well-structured with historical grounding. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Provides specific examples (Syria - 600,000 dead, 15 Russian vetoes; U.S. 40+ vetoes on Israel). Good use of concrete data. Score: 4\n- CON: Strong historical references (Korean War 1950, Gulf War 1991, Kosovo 1999, Libya 50,000 deaths, Vandenberg resolution, Article 108). Excellent grounding. Score: 5\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's consensus argument, addresses P5 withdrawal threat, refutes \"hypocritical crusades\" claim. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Directly addresses PRO's Syria/Ukraine/Gaza examples, provides counter-evidence on Libya, rebuts \"bluff\" characterization. Very effective clash. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Weighs moral legitimacy and accountability against functionality, argues veto enables aggression. Some comparative weighing. Score: 3\n- CON: Clear weighing of UN collapse vs. reform, compares Libya chaos to Syria inaction, emphasizes global war risk. Stronger comparative analysis. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Analysis (Independent Review)\n\nRe-examining the key clash points:\n\n1. **Effectiveness debate**: CON provides stronger comparative evidence (Libya vs. Syria outcomes, 2,700 resolutions vs. 293 vetoes). PRO's Syria example is powerful but CON contextualizes it effectively.\n\n2. **P5 disengagement**: CON provides concrete legal/historical grounding (Vandenberg, UN Participation Act, Article 108). PRO dismisses this as \"bluffing\" but doesn't adequately address the legal constraints.\n\n3. **Moral legitimacy**: PRO makes compelling normative arguments, but CON successfully reframes the debate around realism vs. idealism, arguing functionality trumps moral posturing.\n\n4. **Impact comparison**: CON's \"UN irrelevance \u2192 global war\" impact is more clearly articulated than PRO's \"accountability enables peace\" pathway.\n\n**Revised Scores (confirming first pass):**\n- Argument Quality: PRO 4, CON 4\n- Evidence: PRO 4, CON 5\n- Clash: PRO 4, CON 4\n- Weighing: PRO 3, CON 4\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nThe key decisive factor: CON more effectively engages with the practical constraints (Article 108, legal requirements, historical precedent of P5 behavior) while PRO relies more heavily on normative claims. CON's Libya comparison directly undermines PRO's Syria example. CON's weighing of \"UN collapse risk\" vs. \"moral improvement\" is more developed than PRO's impact calculus.\n\nWinner: CON\nConfidence: 0.70 (Clear but contestable - PRO made strong normative arguments but CON had superior evidence grounding and impact weighing)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 5\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.70,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior evidence grounding and impact weighing.
