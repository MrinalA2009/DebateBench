      "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the resolution beforeusis that social media does more harm than good. I stand firmly in the affirmative. First, social media significantly contributes to mental health issues. Research from the American Psychological Association indicates that increased social media use correlates with higher rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness, particularly among adolescents. The curated perfection of online lives fosters unrealistic expectations, leading to feelings of inadequacy and isolation. Second, social media acts as a breeding ground for misinformation. A study by MIT found that false news spreads six times faster than true news on Twitter. This rampant dissemination of false information undermines public discourse and can have serious consequences, such as influencing elections or public health crises. The recent COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this issue, as misinformation about the virus spread widely, hindering effective responses and endangering lives. Third, social media exacerbates societal division. Algorithms prioritize content that elicits strong emotional reactions, often amplifying divisive rhetoric. This polarization diminishes civil discourse, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to engage with differing viewpoints. The result is a fragmented society where echo chambers thrive, and mutual understanding diminishes. Finally, we must consider the impact on privacy. Social media platforms harvest personal data, often without users\u2019 informed consent, leading to breaches of privacy and security concerns. This exploitation of user data raises ethical questions about autonomy and consent. In conclusion, while social media offers some benefits, the overwhelming evidence reveals that it does more harm than good by negatively impacting mental health, spreading misinformation, fostering division, and compromising privacy. We must prioritize the well-being of society and seek solutions that mitigate these harms. Thank you.",

      "content": "Thank you. I stand in firm opposition to the resolution. Whilemyopponent raises concerns, they fundamentally misunderstand social media's net impact on society. First, let's establish our framework: we must weigh the total benefits against total harms across all users globally. Social media connects 4.9 billion people worldwide, and we cannot dismiss this unprecedented connectivity. Our first contention: social media democratizes information and opportunity. Before social media, marginalized voices had no platform. Now, movements like MeToo and Black Lives Matter have achieved global impact through social media organizing. The Arab Spring demonstrations show how these platforms enable political changeinoppressive regimes. Social media gives everyoneavoice, not just those with traditional media access. Second, social media drives economic opportunity. According to Deloitte, social media contributes over 200 billion dollars annually to the U.S. economy alone. Small businesses reach customers without expensive advertising. Freelancers find work globally. Entrepreneurs build brands from their homes. This economic engine has created millions of jobs and lifted countless people from poverty. Third, social media strengthens relationships and community. Research from Pew shows 81% of teens feel more connected to friends through social media. Families separated by distance maintain bonds. Support communities form around shared experiences, from rare diseases to grief counseling. During COVID-19, social media becamealifeline preventing isolation. Regarding my opponent's harms: mental health issues stem from misuse, not the technology itself. Misinformation existed long before social media\u2014remember yellow journalism? The solution is media literacy, not eliminating the platform. As for privacy, users choose what to share, and regulations like GDPR are addressing concerns. The question isn't whether problems exist, but whether benefits outweigh harms. With billions connected, empowered, and economically enabled, social media clearly does more good than harm.

      "content": "Thank you. Whilemyopponent highlights social media's connectivity and benefits, they overlook significant harms that often outweigh these advantages. First, while social media democratizes information, it also amplifies misinformation. The rapid spread of false information is not merely a side effect but a core issue that impacts public perception and can jeopardize lives. For instance, misinformation about vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic led to hesitancy and preventable deaths. We cannot ignore that the platforms designed to connect us also facilitate the spread of harmful falsehoods. Second, my opponent claims social media fosters economic opportunity. However, the economic benefits primarily favor tech giants and advertisers. Many small businesses struggle against algorithm changes that prioritize paid ads, limiting their visibility. The notion that social mediaisthe great equalizer is misleading when millions of users remain unheard. Third, while social media may strengthen some relationships, the evidence suggests it can also lead to increased feelings of loneliness and isolation. A study published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology found that reducing social media usage can significantly improve mental health outcomes. Finally, regarding privacy, the argument that users can choose what to share ignores the extensive data harvesting practices that compromise user autonomy. Many users are unawareofthe extent of their data exposure. In conclusion, while social media offers certain benefits, the overwhelming evidenceofits negative impacts\u2014mental health deterioration, misinformation proliferation, and privacy violations\u2014indicates that it does more harm than good.

Social media actually enables rapid fact-checking and corrections. The WHO and CDC used these same platforms to disseminate accurate COVID information to billions instantly. The solution is better content moderation, not abandoning the technology. Second, regarding economic benefits favoring tech giants: this is a red herring. My opponent ignores that 200 million small businesses worldwide use Facebook alonetoreach customers. Etsy sellers, independent artists, and local restaurants thrive through Instagram and Tik Tok. Yes, algorithms change, but these platforms still provide access previously impossible without expensive marketing budgets. Third, on mental health: my opponent cherry-picks one study while ignoring context.

We don't ban cars because some people drive recklessly; we teach safe driving. Finally, on privacy: GDPR, CCPA, and emerging regulations address these concerns.
