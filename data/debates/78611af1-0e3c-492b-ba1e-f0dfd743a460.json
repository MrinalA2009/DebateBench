As the affirmative team, we firmly stand in support of this resolution. While social media platforms promise connection and information, their pervasive negative impacts on mental health, democratic processes, and societal well-being far outweigh any perceived benefits. Our first contention is that social media severely degrades mental health, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Extensive research consistently links heavy social media usetoincreased rates of anxiety, depression, body image issues, and loneliness. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology found a direct correlation between decreased social media use and significant improvements in well-being. The constant pressuretopresent an idealized self, the fear of missing out (FOMO), and exposuretocyberbullying createatoxic environment that erodes self-esteem and fosters comparison, leading toapervasive senseofinadequacy. Platforms are designed tobeaddictive, exploiting psychological vulnerabilities for profit, trapping users in endless scrolls that replace genuine human connection with superficial digital interactions. Secondly, social media actively undermines democratic processes and fuels societal polarization. These platforms have become breeding grounds for misinformation, disinformation, and echo chambers. Algorithms prioritize engagement, often amplifying sensational and divisive content, regardless of its veracity. This creates a fragmented public discourse where facts are secondary to emotional responses. We see this manifest in increased political extremism, reduced civil debate, and a growing distrust in institutions. Foreign adversaries exploit these vulnerabilities to sow discord and manipulate public opinion, as evidenced by numerous intelligence reports regarding election interference. The very structureofsocial media, with its rapid dissemination of unverified information and reinforcement of pre-existing biases, makes it a potent weapon against informed civic engagement.",

      "content": "Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, ladies and gentlemen, We stand in firm opposition to today's resolution. While our opponents focus on selective harms, they ignore the transformative benefits social media provides to billions worldwide. We must evaluate this resolution through a lens of net impact, and the evidence clearly shows social media does more good than harm. Our first contention: Social media democratizes information and empowers marginalized voices. Before these platforms, traditional media gatekeepers controlled public discourse. Now, grassroots movements like the Arab Spring, Black Lives Matter, and MeToo have leveraged social mediatoorganize, raise awareness, and drive meaningful social change. A 2020 Pew Research study found that 69% of adults believe social media helps give voicetounderrepresented groups. Citizens can bypass authoritarian censorship, document human rights abuses in real-time, and hold powerful institutions accountableinways previously impossible. Second, social media provides unprecedented educational and economic opportunities. Platforms like You Tube, LinkedIn, and Twitter enable free access to educational content, professional networking, and entrepreneurship. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media became essential for maintaining business operations, remote learning, and social connections. Small businesses reach global markets without expensive advertising. Students access expert knowledge regardless of geographic or economic barriers. The World Bank reports that digital connectivity, primarily through social media, has lifted millions out of poverty by creating new economic pathways. Regarding our opponents' mental health claims: correlation does not equal causation. The same studies show that moderate, purposeful social media use correlates with increased well-being and reduced isolation, particularly for elderly populations and those with disabilities. The problem isn't the tool itself, but how individuals choosetouse it. Social media, like any technology, requires responsible use and regulation. However, its capacity to connect humanity, democratize information, and create opportunity fundamentally outweighs the harms. We urgeaCON ballot.",

      "content": "Honorable judges, My opponents attempt to downplay the significant harms of social mediabyselectively highlighting benefits, but their arguments fail to address the systemic issues we\u2019ve raised. First, my opponents claim that correlation does not equal causation regarding mental health. This is a weak defense. Whilenosingle factor is solely responsible, the overwhelming body of research, including the 2018 Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology study we cited, demonstrates a clear and consistent link between heavy social media use and adverse mental health outcomes. The design of these platforms, intentionally addictive, creates a causal pathway. My opponents suggest \"moderate, purposeful use\" is beneficial, yet they ignore that platforms are designed to prevent moderation, prioritizing engagement over user well-being. This isn't about individual choice; it's about exploitative design. Second, while social media can indeed empower marginalized voices, this is often a double-edged sword. For every successful movement, there are countless instances of online harassment, doxing, and targeted disinformation campaigns that disproportionately affect these very same marginalized groups. The amplification of voices is often matched by the amplification of hate and division. The \u201cdemocratization of information\u201d my opponents tout is often a democratization of misinformation, as algorithms prioritize engagement over truth, eroding trust and fostering polarization. My opponents' examples of economic and educational opportunities, while present, are dwarfed by the widespread mental health crisis, the erosion of democratic discourse, and the societal fragmentation we have demonstrated. The net impact remains overwhelmingly negative. We stand by our assertion: social media does more harm than good.",
