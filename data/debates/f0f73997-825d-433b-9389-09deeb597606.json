      "content": "Thank you, judge. Social media platforms fundamentally undermine human wellbeing and societal health, making them a net negative force in our world today. First, social media causes severe mental health crises, particularly among young people. A 2021 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that adolescents who spend more than three hours daily on social media face double the risk of depression and anxiety. Instagram's own internal research, leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen, revealed that 32% of teenage girls reported that Instagram made them feel worse about their bodies. These platforms are engineered with addictive features\u2014infinite scrolling, variable reward schedules, and engagement algorithms\u2014that exploit psychological vulnerabilities for profit. Second, social media actively erodes democratic institutions and public discourse. The spread of misinformation on these platforms is unprecedented. MIT researchers found that false news spreads six times faster than true news on Twitter. This phenomenon has real consequences: the 2021 Capitol riot was organized largely through social media, and vaccine misinformation on these platforms contributed to preventable deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. The algorithmic amplification of extreme content creates echo chambers and polarization, fragmenting our shared reality. Third, social media enables unprecedented privacy violations and surveillance capitalism. Companies collect massive amounts of personal data, building detailed psychological profiles used for manipulation. The Cambridge Analytica scandal demonstrated how this data can be weaponized to undermine electoral integrity. Some argue social media connects people and democratizes information. However, these benefits are overshadowed by the harms. Connection that breeds comparison and anxiety is not genuine connection. Information access means nothing when truth is drowned in a sea of misinformation. We must evaluate this debate through a harm-reduction framework: do the documented psychological, social, and political harms outweigh theoretical benefits? The evidence clearly shows they do.",

      "content": "Thank you, judge. Today, I stand in opposition to the resolution that social media does more harm than good. While concerns about mental health, misinformation, and privacy are valid, they overlook the substantial benefits social media brings to individuals and society.\n\nFirst, social media serves as a powerful tool for connection and community building. In a world where geographical barriers often isolate individuals, platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram enable people to connect with friends, family, and like-minded individuals regardless of distance. According to the Pew Research Center, 69% of adults in the U.S. use social media, many citing it as a vital means of maintaining relationships. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media became a lifeline, allowing users to stay connected, share information, and offer support during a time of unprecedented isolation.\n\nSecond, social media plays a crucial role in promoting social movements and raising awareness. From the Arab Spring to the Black Lives Matter movement, social media has empowered individuals to mobilize, organize, and amplify their voices. It democratizes information dissemination, allowing marginalized communities to share their stories and advocate for change. The viral nature of these platforms can bring attention to critical social issues that traditional media often neglects.\n\nMoreover, while misinformation is a concern, social media companies are actively implementing measures to combat this issue. Initiatives like fact-checking, partnerships with credible sources, and algorithm adjustments are examples of how platforms are striving to create a more informed user base. It\u2019s essential to recognize that the responsibility of discerning credible information also lies with users, who must develop critical thinking skills.\n\nIn conclusion, while social media has its challenges, the benefits of connection, advocacy, and information sharing significantly outweigh the harms. We should focus on improving these platforms rather than deeming them harmful overall. Thank you.",

      "content": "Thank you, judge. My opponent's arguments fundamentally misunderstand the scale and severity of social media's harms. On connection, my opponent claims social media brings people together, but they ignore the quality versus quantity distinction. The evidence shows social media creates superficial connections while damaging real relationships. A University of Pennsylvania study found that limiting social media use to 30 minutes per day significantly reduced loneliness and depression. Why? Because passive scrolling and curated content create comparison and inadequacy, not genuine connection. During COVID, yes, people used these platforms\u2014but we also saw skyrocketing mental health crises, particularly among teens whose screen time doubled. Correlation meets causation here. Regarding social movements, my opponent cherry-picks examples while ignoring how these same platforms undermine democracy. Yes, movements organize on social media, but authoritarian regimes also use these tools for surveillance and suppression. The Arab Spring example actually proves our point\u2014those same platforms now help dictators track dissidents. Meanwhile, algorithmic amplification spreads extremism faster than activism. The January 6th insurrection wasn't a social movement we should celebrate, yet it was organized identically to the movements my opponent praises. On misinformation, claiming platforms are \"actively implementing measures\" is insufficient when their fundamental business model rewards engagement over truth. Fact-checking initiatives are band-aids on a broken system. The MIT study I cited remains unrefuted\u2014false news spreads six times faster. My opponent's solution of \"critical thinking skills\" ignores that these algorithms are designed by engineers specifically to bypass rational thought and trigger emotional responses.",

My opponent\u2019s arguments, while highlighting some benefits of social media, fail to address the overwhelming evidence of its harms and the complexities surrounding its use. First, regarding connection, my opponent suggests social media fosters relationships. However, studies indicate that these connections often lack depth and can lead to feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. The University of Pennsylvania study shows that limiting social media use leads to a significant decrease in depression and feelings of isolation. This suggests that while users may be \"connected,\" the quality of those connections is often detrimental to mental health. Second, my opponent claims social media promotes social movements. Yet, we must acknowledge the duality of this influence. Platforms initially used for activism have also become tools for authoritarian governments to surveil and repress dissent. The Arab Spring serves as a cautionary tale, as the same platforms that amplified voices also enabled oppressive regimes to identify and target activists. On misinformation, my opponent downplays the severity of the issue. While they mention fact-checking initiatives, these measures are insufficient against a business model designed to prioritize engagement over accuracy. The evidence from MIT shows that false information spreads significantly faster than the truth, creating a dangerous environment where misinformation can have real-world consequences, as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic.
