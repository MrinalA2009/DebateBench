      "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, we affirm that social media does more harm than good. Our main claims are threefold: social media fosters misinformati on, encourages unhealthy comparis on, and facilitates cyberbullying. Firstly, social media has been a breeding ground for misinformati on. The 2020 Stanford study reported that false information spreads six times faster than the truth on social media. This not only misleads individuals but can also lead to societal harm. For instance, the World Health Organization declared misinformation on COVID-19 a massive issue, terming it an \"in fodemic.\" Secondly, social media encourages unhealthy comparis on, leading to mental health issues. A 2019 study by the Journal of Abnormal Psychology indicates a 52% increase in depression among adolescents who spend more time on social media. The constant barrage of idealized lives leads to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfacti on. Lastly, social media facilitates cyberbullying. The Cyberbullying Research Center reported that over 36% of students have been cyberbullied in their lifetime, with the majority of these incidents occurring on social media platforms. The anonymity and wide reach of social media magnify the devastating effects of bullying. Our framework for this debate is a cost-benefit analys is. We must weigh the harms and benefits of social media, considering both individual and societal impacts. If the harms outweigh the benefits, then the resolution stands affirmed. In conclusi on, we assert that social media creates an environment conducive to misinformation spread, fosters harmful comparison leading to mental health issues, and provides a platform for cyberbullying. These points reflect a societal cost that far outweighs any potential benefits, affirming that social media does more harm than good.",

      "content": "While social media undeniably has its flaws, we negate the resolution that it does more harm than good. Social media provides invaluable benefits that outweigh the potential drawbacks. Our three main contentions are that social media enhances communication and connectivity, promotes education and information sharing, and serves as a platform for positive social change. Firstly, social media has revolutionized communicati on, allowing people to connect across geographical boundaries. A 2019 Pew Research Center study found that 91% of Americans believe social media helps them stay connected with friends and family. This connectivity fosters relationships, support systems, and a sense of community that would otherwise be impossible. Secondly, social media promotes education and information sharing. It provides access to a wealth of knowledge, enabling individuals to learn and grow. A 2018 study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that 81% of teachers use social media for professional development. Moreover, social media has been crucial in disseminating important public health information during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported by the CDC. Lastly, social media serves as a powerful platform for positive social change. It amplifies voices, raises awareness, and mobilizes communities for important causes. The Me Too movement, which began on social media, has brought global attention to sexual harassment and assault, leading to significant cultural shifts and legal reforms. We propose a framework that prioritizes the net impact of social media on society. While acknowledging the potential harms, we must also consider the substantial benefits that social media brings. The positive effects on communicati on, educati on, and social change far outweigh the negatives. In conclusi on, social media is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or bad. By focusing on its benefits and working to mitigate its risks, we can harness the power",

First, while social media can enhance communication and connectivity, this connectivity is often superficial and, in extreme cases, can lead to cyberbullying, as we highlighted earlier. Moreover, a 2019 survey from the American Psychological Association found that over half of respondents felt that social media hampers personal relationships rather than enhancing them. Second, although social media can promote educati on, it is also a breeding ground for misinformati on. The same tools that enable information sharing can equally spread false informati on, as evidenced by the Stanford study we mentioned earlier. The COVID-19 \"in fodemic\" further underscores this point. Third, while social media can serve as a platform for positive social change, it can also amplify hate speech and divisi on. For instance, the United Nations cited social media as a major factor in the spread of hate speech and violence in Myanmar in 2018. Our opponents suggest that we can focus on the benefits and work to mitigate the risks. However, the question is not whether social media can be good or bad, but whether it does more harm than good in its current state. Given the evidence, we maintain that the harms of social media - from misinformation to mental health issues to cyberbullying - outweigh the benefits. Therefore, the resolution stands affirmed.",

However, they disregard the countless examples of meaningful relationships fostered through social media, from long-distance families staying connected to support groups for individuals facing challenges. Cyberbullying, while a serious issue, is not inherent to social media but a reflection of broader societal problems. Secondly, they argue that social media spreads misinformati on, but fail to acknowledge the efforts of social media platforms to combat this issue through fact-checking and content moderati on. Moreover, social media has been instrumental in disseminating accurate information during crises, as evidenced by its role during natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirdly, while they highlight instances of hate speech amplified by social media, they overlook the countless social movements and positive changes catalyzed by these platforms, from the Arab Spring to the Black Lives Matter movement. Social media gives voice to the marginalized and oppressed, enabling them to advocate for change. Our opponents' framework of focusing on the current state of social media is shortsighted.
