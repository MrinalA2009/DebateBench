Our argument rests on three primary pillars: safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Firstly, let's address safety. According to a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrati on, 94% of car accidents in 2017 were due to human err or. Autonomous driving eliminates these errors, such as drunk driving, speeding, and distracted driving. A study by RAND Corporation projects that widespread use of autonomous vehicles could save up to 1.2 million lives globally per year. Secondly, autonomous vehicles are more efficient. They can reduce traffic congestion because they can communicate with each other to maintain optimal speed and distance, as per research from Columbia University. Additionally, autonomous vehicles can significantly decrease the time spent on driving, increasing productivity. Lastly, autonomous vehicles promote environmental sustainability. According to a report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, self-driving cars can be programmed for optimal energy efficiency, reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. We propose a framework that values human life, efficiency, and environmental health as key metrics in this debate. We are not arguing that the transition will be easy or immediate, but rather, it is a necessary step towards a safer, more efficient, and sustainable future. Hence, we urge you to affirm the resoluti on.",

      "content": "While the affirmative side presents compelling arguments, we must consider the significant drawbacks and challenges associated with mandating autonomous vehicles and banning human driving. Firstly, the technology is not yet perfected. As per a 2020 study by the American Automobile Associati on, even the most advanced self-driving systems available today are not 100% reliable in detecting and responding to hazards. Forcing a premature transition could lead to catastrophic accidents. Secondly, mandating autonomous vehicles would be a severe infringement on personal freedom and choice. Many people enjoy driving and value the sense of control and independence it provides. Banning human driving would be a draconian measure that undermines individual liberty. Thirdly, the economic impact of such a mandate would be substantial. Millions of jobs in the transportation sect or, from taxi drivers to truck drivers, would be lost. The cost of replacing the entire vehicle fleet with autonomous cars would be astronomical, placing a huge financial burden on individuals and businesses. Furthermore, the affirmative side's framework overlooks the importance of personal freedom and economic stability. While safety, efficiency, and sustainability are crucial, they must be balanced against the right of individuals to make their own choices and the need to maintain a stable economy. We propose a more measured approach: encouraging the development and adoption of autonomous vehicles through incentives and regulations, while allowing human driving to continue. This would allow for a gradual, less disruptive transition that respects individual rights and mitigates economic upheaval. In conclusi on, we urge you to reject the resolution and oppose the mandatory implementation of autonomous vehicles and the ban on human driving.",

According to Waymo, its self-driving cars have driven over 10 million miles in real-world conditions, continually learning and refining their algorithms. Moreover, the imperfection of the technology does not negate the fact that it still outperforms human drivers in terms of safety, as per the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrati on. Secondly, the argument about personal freedom is noteworthy. However, public safety is a critical consideration that supersedes individual liberty. We have similar laws in place for the greater good, like seat belt regulations. Thirdly, the economic argument underestimates the new job opportunities that the autonomous vehicle sector would create. A study by Intel predicts that autonomous vehicles could generate a new \"passenger economy\" worth $7 trillion by 2050. In conclusi on, while we acknowledge the challenges posed by this transiti on, we firmly believe that the benefits of autonomous vehicles - in terms of safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability - far outweigh the cons. We must not resist change due to the fear of temporary disrupti on; instead, we should embrace it for the promise of a better future.

However, they fail to provide concrete evidence that it will reach a level of perfection necessary for a complete ban on human driving. The fact remains that current technology is not infallible, and forcing a premature transition could lead to disastrous consequences. Moreover, the comparison to seat belt laws is flawed. While seat belts are a safety measure, they do not completely remove the freedom to drive. Banning human driving altogether is a far more extreme and restrictive measure that infringes upon personal liberty. The economic argument put forth by the affirmative side is speculative at best. While new jobs may be created, there is no guarantee that they will be sufficient to offset the millions of jobs lost in the transportation sect or. The financial burden on individuals and businesses to replace their vehicles would be immense and could lead to widespread economic hardship. Furthermore, the affirmative side fails to address the significant infrastructure changes and costs associated with a mandatory transition to autonomous vehicles. The current road system is designed for human drivers, and a complete overhaul would be necessary to accommodate self-driving cars. In conclusi on, while the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are notable, the affirmative side's argument for a mandatory ban on human driving is premature and fails to consider the significant drawbacks and challenges involved.
