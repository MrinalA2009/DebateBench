      "content": "Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, The resolution before us today is: Resolved: Diplomatic immunity should be limited. We, the affirmative, firmly uphold this resolution. While diplomatic immunity serves a vital function in international relations, its current expansive scope has created a system ripe for abuse, undermining justice and eroding public trust. We propose a limitation that balances the need for diplomatic functionality with accountability. Our first contention is that unlimited diplomatic immunity enables serious criminal behavior without consequence. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, while crucial for ensuring diplomats can perform their duties without harassment, grants near-absolute immunity from criminal prosecution in the host state. This broad protection has been exploited. The BBC reported in 2018 that over 5,000 serious crimes, including murder, rape, and assault, were committed by individuals with diplomatic immunity in the UK alone over a five-year period, with virtually no prosecutions. This impunity is a grave injustice to victims and a mockery of the rule of law. When diplomats commit heinous acts and face no legal repercussions, it sends a dangerous message that certain individuals are above the law, fostering resentment and undermining the very international cooperation immunity is meant to facilitate. Our second contention is that the current system undermines the principle of equality before the law. A cornerstone of justice in democratic societies is that all individuals are subject to the same laws. Diplomatic immunity, in its current form, creates a privileged class exempt from this fundamental principle. This disparity is not only morally objectionable but also practically damaging. It breeds cynicism among the populace and can strain bilateral relations when host nations feel powerless to address crimes committed on their soil. Limiting immunity, particularly for serious non-official acts, would restore a measure of fairness and uphold the universal value of accountability.",

      "content": "Honorable judges, worthy opponents, today we gather to discuss the resolution that diplomatic immunity should be limited. As the negative team, we strongly disagree with this proposition. Diplomatic immunity is a cornerstone of international relations, ensuring that diplomats can carry out their duties without fear of harassment or undue interference from the host country. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which grants diplomatic immunity, is a carefully crafted treaty that balances the need for diplomatic functionality with the rights of the host state.\n\nOur opponents argue that unlimited diplomatic immunity enables serious criminal behavior without consequence, citing instances of crimes committed by individuals with diplomatic immunity. However, they overlook the fact that the sending state retains jurisdiction over its diplomats and can prosecute them under their own laws. In practice, diplomats who commit serious crimes are often declared persona non grata and expelled from the host country, and their immunity is waived by their own government. This mechanism provides a sufficient check on diplomatic misconduct.\n\nMoreover, limiting diplomatic immunity would have unintended consequences, such as retaliatory measures from other countries and a breakdown in international cooperation. Diplomats are not above the law, but they do operate in a unique context that requires special protections. The current system of diplomatic immunity is not a blanket exemption from accountability, but rather a necessary tool for ensuring the smooth functioning of international relations. We must be cautious not to undermine the delicate balance of diplomatic relations by introducing limitations that could be exploited for political gain or used to harass diplomats. Instead, we should focus on strengthening the existing mechanisms for addressing diplomatic misconduct and promoting cooperation between nations.",

      "content": "My esteemed opponents argue that the sending state retains jurisdiction and can prosecute their diplomats, and that expulsion is a sufficient check. This is a fundamentally flawed argument. While theoretically true, in practice, prosecution by the sending state is rare, and expulsion is a reactive measure, not a preventative one. It does not deliver justice to victims in the host country, nor does it deter future crimes effectively. The BBC report I cited earlier, detailing over 5,000 serious crimes in the UK with virtually no prosecutions, directly refutes the idea that current mechanisms are sufficient. Expulsion simply removes the problem, it doesn't resolve the injustice.\n\nThey also claim that limiting immunity would lead to retaliatory measures and a breakdown in international cooperation. This is a fear-mongering tactic. We are not advocating for the abolition of diplomatic immunity, but for its *limitation*, specifically for serious non-official acts. This distinction is crucial. Immunity for official duties would remain intact, ensuring diplomatic functionality. What we propose is a targeted approach that holds individuals accountable for egregious personal crimes, thereby strengthening, not weakening, international relations by fostering trust and respect for the rule of law. When host nations feel their citizens are protected, cooperation is enhanced, not diminished. The current system, where diplomats can literally get away with murder, is what truly undermines trust and cooperation.",

However, they fail to consider the broader implications of such a move. Limiting diplomatic immunity, even if only for serious non-official acts, would set a dangerous precedent. It would open the door for host countries to exploit these limitations for political leverage, undermining the very foundation of diplomatic relations. The affirmative cites the BBC report on crimes committed by individuals with diplomatic immunity, but they neglect to mention that these instances, although disturbing, are extremely rare compared to the vast number of diplomats serving worldwide. Moreover, the report does not provide evidence that limiting immunity would have prevented these crimes. In fact, the sending states' ability to prosecute their own diplomats and the practice of declaring individuals persona non grata provide sufficient checks on misconduct. Furthermore, the affirmative's proposal for a targeted approach to limiting immunity is naive. In practice, distinguishing between official and non-official acts can be complex and contentious, leading to disputes and further straining international relations. The current system, while not perfect, has been refined over centuries to balance the need for diplomatic functionality with the rights of host states. We should focus on strengthening existing mechanisms for addressing diplomatic misconduct rather than risking the stability of international relations by introducing potentially disruptive limitations on diplomatic immunity.",
