      "content": "Good afternoon. As the affirmative, we proudly uphold the resolution: Deep-sea mining should be prohibited. The deep ocean is Earth's last pristine frontier, home to unique ecosystems that regulate global climate and oxygen production. We must protect it under the precautionary principle as our framework: when scientific uncertainty looms over irreversible harm, prohibition is justified until proven safe.\n\nContention One: Deep-sea mining inflicts catastrophic, irreversible environmental damage. Machines would scrape polymetallic nodules from the seafloor, habitats that take millions of years to form. A 2023 Nature study warns sediment plumes could spread over 100 kilometers, smothering fragile species like sponges and corals\u201490% of which are undiscovered, per the Census of Marine Life. These ecosystems produce 50% of Earth's oxygen via microbes, per Schmidt Ocean Institute research. Mining would trigger mass extinctions, disrupting food webs and fisheries worth $100 billion annually to global economies. No technology can mitigate this; trials by The Metals Company already caused plume damage persisting years later.\n\nContention Two: Economic promises are illusory, while alternatives abound. Proponents tout critical minerals for batteries, but the World Bank estimates deep-sea operations won't be viable until 2035, too late for green transitions. Recycling and land-based sources\u2014like Indonesia's nickel mines\u2014supply 95% of needs at lower costs, per USGS data. Norway's 2023 parliamentary rejection proves even mineral-hungry nations prioritize sustainability over speculative profits.\n\nContention Three: Inadequate regulation invites global tragedy. The International Seabed Authority lacks enforcement power; China and Russia dominate, risking a race to the bottom. Prohibition enforces ISA's moratorium calls and UNCLOS obligations.\n\nIn sum, the precautionary principle demands we ban deep-sea mining to avert ecological collapse. Vote affirmative for our planet's future. Thank you.",

Our stance is grounded in the principle of responsible utilization of resources, where human needs and environmental concerns are balanced.\n\nThe affirmative's contention that deep-sea mining inflicts catastrophic environmental damage is overstated. While it is true that mining operations can cause sediment plumes, advancements in technology have made it possible to minimize these effects. For instance, the use of remotely operated vehicles and carefully designed collection systems can significantly reduce the impact on the seafloor. Moreover, the International Seabed Authority has established strict environmental regulations for deep-sea mining, including the requirement for environmental impact assessments and the implementation of mitigation measures.\n\nRegarding the economic aspect, the affirmative's assertion that deep-sea mining is not viable until 2035 is misleading. Several companies, such as Nautilus Minerals and DeepGreen Metals, are already making significant investments in deep-sea mining technology, with some operations expected to commence as early as 2025. These ventures have the potential to provide critical minerals, such as copper and nickel, which are essential for the production of renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles.\n\nFurthermore, prohibition is not an effective solution to the regulatory challenges faced by the International Seabed Authority. Instead, we should focus on strengthening the authority's enforcement powers and promoting international cooperation to ensure that deep-sea mining is conducted in a responsible and sustainable manner. By adopting a balanced approach, we can harness the benefits of deep-sea mining while minimizing its environmental impacts. We urge you to consider the potential benefits of deep-sea mining and reject the resolution.",

DeepGreen (now TMC) admits losses; meanwhile, USGS data shows land recycling and mines supply 95% of nickel/copper needs cheaper.
