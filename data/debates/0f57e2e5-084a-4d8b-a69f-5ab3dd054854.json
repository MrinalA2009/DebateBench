      "content": "Judge, I affirm. The resolution asks whether gender identity should be protected under the law, meaning included in civil rights and related statutes so people cannot be denied jobs, housing, education, healthcare, or public services becauseoftheir gender identity. Framework: prioritize preventing unjust discrimination and protecting equal citizenship. The best policy is the one that most effectively secures basic rights and safety for all with minimal burden on others. Contention 1: Legal protection prevents material harm in core life areas. When discrimination is legal or ambiguous, people can be fired, evicted, or denied services for simply being who they are. Evidence shows this is not hypothetical: the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey reported high rates of workplace mistreatment and housing instability among trans respondents, and discrimination correlates with poverty and homelessness. Protecting gender identity creates clear rules for employers, landlords, schools, and providers, reducing arbitrary exclusion and stabilizing access to livelihoods. Contention 2: Protection reduces violence and improves public safety. Marginalized groups face higher targeting when society signals they are \u201cless protected.\u201d Anti-discrimination and hate-crime protections increase reporting, improve law enforcement response, and deter misconduct by raising expected consequences. Even when not perfectly enforced, the law sets norms: it communicates that harassment and exclusion are unacceptable, which shifts institutional behavior in schools and workplaces where most daily harm occurs. Contention 3: This is consistent with liberal legal principles and imposes limited costs. Protecting gender identity does not create special rights; it extends the same baseline rule already used for race, religion, and sex: decisions should be based on merit and conduct, not identity. Reasonable accommodations and existing exemptions (like for sincerely held religious practices within certain contexts) can be handled the same way courts already balance competing rights. For these reasons, legal protection is necessary to secure equal opportunity and basic safety.",

      "content": "Judge, I negate. While discrimination is wrong, this resolution asks whether gender identity specifically should be protected under law. We argue the answer is no, for three critical reasons. Contention 1: Definitional incoherence creates legal chaos. Unlike raceorsex, gender identity lacks clear, objective boundaries. If gender identity is purely self-defined and can changeatany time, the law cannot provide stable, administrable standards. Courts and employers would face impossible questions: How doweverify claims? Can identity change daily? This isn't theoretical\u2014we've seen litigation over bathroom access, sports eligibility, and prison placement wherenoclear legal standard exists. The California Family Council documented multiple cases where schools struggled to create coherent policies when gender identity could be asserted without any external criteria. Contention 2: Conflicts with existing protected rights. Adding gender identity protection creates direct collisions with religious freedom, women's safety, and parental rights. Religious adoption agencies have been forced to close rather than violate beliefs. Women's shelters face lawsuits for maintaining sex-based admissions. The Heritage Foundation reports that TitleIXreinterpretation to include gender identity has eliminated women's privacy in locker rooms and undermined fair athletic competition, directly harming the very populations civil rights laws were meant to protect. These aren't hypothetical accommodations\u2014they're zero-sum conflicts where someone's rights must yield. Contention 3: Existing laws already prohibit actionable harms. Assault, harassment, and contract violations are already illegal regardless of victim identity. The affirmative cited discrimination but didn't show current law is insufficient. We don't need identity-based protection when conduct-based laws already apply universally. Adding more protected classes doesn't reduce violence\u2014enforcement does. The resolution fails becauseitwould create unworkable legal standards, violate established rights, and providenobenefit beyond existing protections. For these reasons, I urgeanegative ballot.",
