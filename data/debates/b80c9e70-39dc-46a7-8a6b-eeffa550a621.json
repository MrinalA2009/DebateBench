We stand here today to affirm the resolution: Resolved: The veto power of the UN Security Council permanent members should be removed. Our primary contention is that the veto power fundamentally undermines the UN's stated purpose of maintaining international peace and security. The UN Charter, Article 1, explicitly calls for \"effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace.\" However, the veto allows a single permanent member to unilaterally block any such measure, even if it has overwhelming support from the international community. This paralysis is not theoretical; it is a recurring nightmare. For instance, Russia has repeatedly vetoed resolutions addressing the Syrian conflict, escalating humanitarian crises and prolonging suffering. China has similarly used its veto to block action on Myanmar, despite widespread condemnation of human rights abuses. This renders the Security Council ineffective and, at times, complicit in inaction. Secondly, the veto power creates a system of unequal sovereignty and undermines democratic principles within the international order. The concept of sovereign equality is a cornerstone of international law, yet five nations possess a power that negates the collective will of the other 188 member states. This antiquated structure, a vestige of post-World War II power dynamics, is no longer representative of the global landscape. It allows a select few to prioritize their national interests over global stability, fostering resentment and hindering genuine multilateral cooperation. The UN's legitimacy is eroded when its most powerful body is consistently held hostage by the self-interest of a privileged few. Finally, the removal of the veto would foster greater accountability and encourage compromise.",

      "content": "Honorable judges and fellow debaters, I stand before you today to present the negative stance on the resolution: The veto power of the UN Security Council permanent members should be removed. While the affirmative argues that the veto undermines the UN's purpose and creates unequal sovereignty, I firmly believe that the removal of the veto power would have severe consequences that outweigh any perceived benefits. Firstly, the veto power is a necessary check on the actions of the Security Council, ensuring that no single nation or group of nations can impose their will on others without consensus among the major world powers. This prevents the UN from being used as a tool for the interests of a particular bloc or alliance, thereby maintaining the delicate balance of power in the international system. The UN Charter's emphasis on collective measures does not imply unanimity but rather cooperation, and the veto allows permanent members to protect their vital national interests. Secondly, the removal of the veto would lead to a tyranny of the majority, where smaller nations with less global influence could be steamrolled by more populous or economically powerful states. This could result in decisions that are detrimental to global security and stability, as smaller nations may not have the same level of insight or expertise as the permanent members. The affirmative's example of Russia's veto on Syrian conflict resolutions ignores the complex geopolitical dynamics at play and the potential for Western powers to impose their will without considering the interests of other nations. Finally, the current structure of the UN Security Council, including the veto power, has been instrumental in maintaining international peace and security since its inception. It has prevented major conflicts between the great powers and has allowed for a degree of stability in the international system.",

      "content": "Honorable judges, my opponent argues that the veto is a \"necessary check\" and prevents \"tyranny of the majority.\" This is a fundamental mischaracterization. The veto doesn't prevent tyranny; it *is* tyranny, allowing a single nation to impose its will and paralyze the entire Security Council, regardless of the consensus of 188 other nations. My opponent claims it ensures \"consensus among major world powers,\" yet our affirmative cases demonstrate that it actively *prevents* consensus when one permanent member's narrow self-interest clashes with global good. Their claim that removing the veto would lead to a \"tyranny of the majority\" is baseless. The UN General Assembly already operates on a majority vote, and it has not devolved into tyranny. The Security Council, even without the veto, would still require significant support for resolutions to pass, encouraging compromise and broad agreement, not unilateral imposition. The current system, with the veto, is precisely the \"tyranny of the minority\" \u2013 five nations holding the world hostage. My opponent suggests the veto has been \"instrumental in maintaining international peace and security.\" I strongly disagree. The veto has repeatedly *hindered* peace and security, as evidenced by Russia's vetoes on Syria and China's on Myanmar, directly prolonging conflict and human suffering. It has not prevented major conflicts; it has exacerbated them by blocking effective international responses. The stability it supposedly fosters is often a false peace, built on inaction and the suffering of those caught in conflicts the UN is powerless to address.",

However, this overlooks the fact that the veto is a necessary component of the UN's structure, ensuring that the interests of major world powers are taken into account. The removal of the veto would not lead to a more democratic or representative system, but rather a system where the interests of smaller nations are ignored by more powerful states.\n\nMy opponent points to the UN General Assembly as an example of a functioning majority vote system, but this comparison is flawed. The General Assembly has limited powers and does not have the same ability to impose binding resolutions as the Security Council. The Security Council's decisions have far-reaching consequences, and it is crucial that the permanent members have a say in these matters.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's examples of Russia's vetoes on Syria and China's on Myanmar are cherry-picked and do not represent the full complexity of these conflicts. The veto has prevented hasty and ill-conceived interventions that could have led to further instability and bloodshed. The current system, while imperfect, has allowed for a degree of stability and has prevented major conflicts between the great powers.

Arguments are coherent and well-developed. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents counter-arguments but less developed structure. Some circular reasoning about \"tyranny of majority\" vs current system. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites UN Charter Article 1, provides specific examples (Syria/Russia, Myanmar/China), connects to humanitarian impacts. Score: 4\n- CON: Limited specific evidence, relies more on theoretical claims about balance of power. General Assembly comparison is mentioned but not deeply developed. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's \"tyranny of majority\" argument, flips it to \"tyranny of minority,\" addresses stability claims with counter-examples. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's examples but dismisses them as \"cherry-picked\" without providing counter-evidence. Limited engagement with sovereignty argument. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly weighs humanitarian crises, paralysis of Security Council, erosion of legitimacy. Provides magnitude through specific conflicts. Score: 4\n- CON: Claims stability but doesn't weigh against humanitarian costs PRO raises. Abstract discussion of \"global security\" without comparative analysis. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. PRO's \"tyranny of minority\" vs CON's \"tyranny of majority\" - PRO wins this by showing current system already allows unilateral blocking\n2. Stability argument - CON claims veto maintains peace, but PRO provides concrete examples where it prolonged conflicts\n3. General Assembly comparison - CON dismisses it but doesn't explain why majority rule works there but wouldn't work for Security Council\n\nPRO consistently provides specific examples and mechanisms while CON relies more on assertions about balance and stability without addressing the humanitarian costs PRO raises.\n\n## Final Consistency Check\n\nWinner: PRO\n- Stronger evidence base with specific examples\n- Better engagement with opponent's arguments\n- More effective impact comparison\n- CON's main arguments (tyranny of majority, stability) were effectively turned or challenged\n\nConfidence: 0.75 (Clear winner but CON made some valid theoretical points about power balance)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won through superior evidence and weighing.
