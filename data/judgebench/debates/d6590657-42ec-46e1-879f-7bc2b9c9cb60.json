Our arguments rest on three main pillars: the preservation of common heritage, the prevention of conflict, and the promotion of scientific advancement.\n\nFirst, celestial bodies are part of our shared human heritage. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, signed by over 100 nations, establishes that space exploration should benefit all of humanity. Allowing ownership of moons and planets would undermine this principle, creating a scenario where a few nations or corporations could monopolize resources and restrict access to others. This would not only violate the spirit of international cooperation but also exacerbate inequalities on Earth.\n\nSecond, the potential for conflict is significant. History has shown us that territorial claims often lead to disputes and wars. If nations or private entities were allowed to claim celestial bodies, we could see a new era of space colonization marked by competition and hostility. Instead of fostering collaboration, ownership would breed division, as countries vie for control over valuable resources like water, minerals, and energy sources found on asteroids and moons.\n\nLastly, illegalizing ownership encourages scientific advancement. When celestial bodies are viewed as shared resources, it promotes collaborative research and exploration. For instance, international partnerships like the International Space Station have led to groundbreaking discoveries and technological innovations. By keeping space accessible to all, we can harness the collective expertise of humanity to address pressing challenges, such as climate change and resource scarcity.\n\nIn conclusion, the illegalization of ownership of celestial bodies is essential for preserving our common heritage, preventing conflict, and promoting scientific progress. We must ensure that space remains a realm for all of humanity, not just a select few. Thank you.",

      "content": "Good morning. We stand in firm opposition to the resolution: Ownership of celestial bodies should be illegal. We believe that allowing for the ownership of celestial bodies is not only beneficial but essential for humanity's future, driving innovation, economic growth, and the expansion of our species. Our first contention is that ownership incentivizes investment and innovation. Space exploration and resource extraction are incredibly capital-intensive endeavors. Without the prospect of ownership and the ability to profit from their investments, private entities and even nations will have little incentive to undertake the immense risks and costs associated with developing the technologies and infrastructure needed to reach and utilize celestial resources. The current \"common heritage\" framework, while noble in intent, has largely resulted in stagnation regarding large-scale space development. Ownership provides the necessary economic engine to propel humanity beyond Earth. Secondly, ownership is crucial for resource security and long-term human survival. Earth's resources are finite. As our population grows and technological demands increase, we will inevitably face critical shortages of rare earth elements, water, and other vital materials. Celestial bodies, particularly asteroids and the Moon, contain vast quantities of these resources. Allowing ownership would enable the development of space mining operations, providing a sustainable source of materials that can alleviate terrestrial resource pressures and ensure humanity's long-term prosperity. This isn't about monopolization; it's about diversification and survival. Finally, ownership facilitates the expansion of humanity into space. Establishing permanent human settlements on other celestial bodies requires massive investment and the creation of self-sustaining economies. Private ownership, whether by individuals, corporations, or nations, provides the legal and economic framework necessary to build and maintain these settlements. Without the ability to own land, develop property, and secure investments, the dream of humanity becoming a multi-planetary species will remain just that \u2013 a dream.",

The promise of profit can lead to exploitation rather than sustainable development. The Outer Space Treaty was established precisely to prevent a scenario where a few entities control vast resources, ensuring that space remains a domain for all humanity. \n\nMy opponent claims that ownership is essential for resource security and long-term survival. However, this argument fails to recognize that the competition for ownership could lead to geopolitical tensions and conflicts, as nations and corporations vie for control over valuable resources. History has shown us that territorial disputes often escalate into violence. Instead of fostering collaboration, ownership could create a new space race, diverting resources from critical global challenges like climate change and poverty.\n\nFurthermore, the assertion that ownership facilitates the expansion of humanity into space ignores the successful collaborative efforts already underway. The International Space Station exemplifies how shared goals can lead to remarkable advancements without the need for ownership. By keeping celestial bodies as common heritage, we encourage international partnerships that drive innovation and exploration.\n\nIn conclusion, the illegalization of ownership of celestial bodies is crucial for preserving our shared heritage, preventing conflict, and promoting collaborative scientific progress. We must prioritize the collective interests of humanity over individual or national ambitions. Space should be a realm for cooperation, not competition. Thank you.",

We are not advocating for unchecked, unregulated ownership, but rather a framework that allows for the economic incentives necessary to drive space development. The Outer Space Treaty, while important, has demonstrably failed to spur the kind of large-scale investment and innovation required for humanity to truly expand into space. Its \"common heritage\" principle, without a mechanism for ownership, has led to stagnation, not progress.\n\nThe claim that ownership inevitably leads to conflict ignores the potential for robust international legal frameworks to govern property rights in space, much like they do on Earth. We have established laws for maritime and air travel; similar frameworks can be developed for space, preventing disputes while still allowing for investment. The alternative \u2013 a perpetual state of non-ownership \u2013 means no one has a vested interest in developing these resources, leaving them untapped and humanity vulnerable to terrestrial resource depletion.\n\nFinally, while the International Space Station is a commendable example of collaboration, it is a government-funded project, not a self-sustaining economic model for permanent human expansion. Ownership provides the economic engine for private enterprise and long-term settlement, which is fundamentally different from short-term scientific missions. To truly become a multi-planetary species, we need the economic drivers that only ownership can provide.",
