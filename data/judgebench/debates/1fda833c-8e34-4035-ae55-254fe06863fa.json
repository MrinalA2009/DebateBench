      "content": "Good morning, everyone. The resolution before us today is: Resolved: Tipping culture should be abolished in favor of higher service wages. We, the Affirmative, firmly stand in support of this resolution. Tipping, while seemingly a benevolent act, is an outdated and inequitable system that perpetuates wage instability, fosters discrimination, and ultimately harms both workers and consumers. Replacing it with a standardized, higher wage system is a necessary step towards a fairer and more transparent economy. Our first contention is that tipping creates wage instability and economic insecurity for service workers. The income of tipped employees is inherently unpredictable, fluctuating based on customer generosity, economic downturns, and even the weather. This instability makes budgeting, saving, and planning for the future incredibly difficult. A 2021 One Fair Wage study found that tipped workers are twice as likely to experience poverty compared to non-tipped workers. By contrast, a guaranteed higher wage provides a stable, predictable income, allowing workers to meet their basic needs and achieve financial security. This stability benefits not only the individual worker but also the broader economy through increased consumer confidence and spending. Our second contention is that tipping culture fosters discrimination and harassment. Tipped workers, particularly those in customer-facing roles, are often pressured to tolerate inappropriate behavior from patrons to secure their income. Studies by the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC United) have repeatedly shown that women and people of color in tipped positions experience higher rates of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. When a worker's livelihood depends on the subjective judgment and generosity of customers, it creates a power imbalance that can be exploited. A fixed, higher wage removes this perverse incentive, empowering workers to report and refuse to tolerate harassment without fear of financial retaliation.",

      "content": "Good morning, everyone. Today, I stand in opposition to the resolution: Resolved: Tipping culture should be abolished in favor of higher service wages. While the Affirmative raises valid concerns, abolishing tipping would overlook the benefits it provides to both workers and consumers. First, tipping incentivizes exceptional service. When customers have the power to reward good service directly, it encourages workers to go above and beyond. A study by Cornell University found that servers who receive tips tend to provide better service, leading to higher customer satisfaction. This system fosters a competitive environment where employees are motivated to improve their performance, ultimately benefiting consumers. Second, tipping allows for flexibility in income. Many service workers prefer the current system because it enables them to earn more during busy shifts or peak seasons. For instance, a skilled bartender can significantly increase their earnings on a Friday night compared to a slow Tuesday. This flexibility is particularly important for workers who may have varying financial needs or personal circumstances. A fixed wage could limit their earning potential and reduce their overall job satisfaction. Moreover, the transition to a higher wage system could lead to unintended consequences. Employers may respond to increased labor costs by raising menu prices, which could deter customers and reduce overall business. A study from the National Restaurant Association indicated that a significant increase in wages could lead to job losses in the industry, as businesses struggle to maintain profitability. Finally, tipping culture is deeply ingrained in many societies, and a sudden abolition could create confusion and resentment among both workers and customers. Instead of eliminating tipping, we should focus on reforming the system to ensure fair wages while preserving the benefits of tipping. In conclusion, tipping culture should not be abolished.",

      "content": "My opponent argues that tipping incentivizes exceptional service, claiming it encourages workers to \"go above and beyond.\" However, this argument fundamentally misunderstands the nature of service work. Quality service should be a baseline expectation, not a discretionary reward. Tipping creates a perverse incentive where workers might prioritize customers perceived as \"good tippers\" over others, leading to inconsistent service quality. Furthermore, the idea that a server's income should depend on their ability to perform for tips rather than a fair wage is exploitative. A professional wage ensures consistent, high-quality service for all customers, regardless of their perceived generosity. My opponent also suggests that tipping allows for \"flexibility in income,\" enabling workers to earn more during busy periods. While this might seem appealing, it directly contradicts our first contention: wage instability. This \"flexibility\" is precisely the problem, as it means income is unpredictable and unreliable. Workers shouldn't have to rely on the whims of customers or the luck of a busy night to make ends meet. A stable, higher wage provides true financial flexibility by allowing workers to budget and plan with certainty, rather than hoping for a good shift. Finally, the claim that abolishing tipping would lead to job losses due to increased menu prices is a scare tactic. Many restaurants have successfully transitioned to a no-tipping model, often finding that increased employee morale and reduced turnover offset initial cost concerns. Customers are often willing to pay slightly higher, transparent prices when they know workers are being paid fairly.",
