  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (inclusivity, cognitive development, global economy) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents three counter-contentions (logistical/financial burdens, quality dilution, local control) with clear reasoning. Effectively challenges feasibility. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific statistics (21% non-English speakers), references American Council on Teaching Foreign Languages, New American Economy study, Center for Applied Linguistics. Provides concrete examples (San Francisco, Miami programs). Score: 4\n- CON: References National Center for Education Statistics, mentions 350+ languages statistic, but relies more on logical reasoning than cited studies. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's logistical concerns with dual-language immersion examples, counters quality dilution with research, responds to local control argument. Score: 4\n- CON: Strongly engages PRO's arguments, distinguishes voluntary vs. mandatory programs, challenges the \"most prevalent languages\" solution as insufficient, questions the applicability of PRO's research. Score: 5\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Frames benefits as \"investment in future,\" mentions long-term savings, but limited comparative weighing against CON's concerns. Score: 3\n- CON: Explicitly weighs \"practicality versus idealism,\" emphasizes that benefits depend on well-resourced programs which mandate wouldn't provide, compares costs of overhaul vs. existing ESL programs. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- CON effectively challenges the feasibility of PRO's proposal by distinguishing between existing voluntary programs and a universal mandate\n- PRO provides more concrete evidence but doesn't fully resolve the resource allocation problem\n- CON's \"race to the bottom\" argument about teacher quality under mandate is not adequately answered\n- CON's weighing that PRO's benefits require well-resourced programs (which mandate wouldn't guarantee) is a critical distinction\n\nThe key clash is whether PRO's cited benefits from existing programs would translate to a mandatory system. CON wins this clash by emphasizing resource constraints.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nCON wins through superior clash and weighing. While PRO presents well-evidenced benefits of bilingual education, CON effectively argues these benefits depend on voluntary, well-resourced programs. CON's distinction between existing successful programs and a universal mandate is not adequately refuted by PRO. CON's weighing of feasibility concerns against idealistic benefits is more developed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 5\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior clash and weighing.
