  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents a clear position that diplomatic immunity should be limited, distinguishes between official and personal acts, maintains coherent structure throughout. Score: 4\n- CON: Articulates clear contentions about diplomatic function, retaliation risks, and existing mechanisms. Well-structured arguments about Vienna Convention's role. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References general examples (human trafficking, assault, espionage) but lacks specific cases or data. Relies heavily on assertions about \"most diplomats\" and \"most countries\" without support. Score: 2\n- CON: Cites Vienna Convention as concrete legal framework, explains specific mechanisms (waivers, persona non grata), provides logical reasoning about reciprocity in international relations. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Engages CON's Vienna Convention argument, addresses retaliation concerns, responds to mechanism arguments. However, doesn't fully address the \"who decides\" challenge about official vs. personal acts. Score: 3\n- CON: Directly challenges PRO's official/personal distinction with specific question (\"Who decides?\"), refutes the \"different era\" claim, addresses the formalization argument point-by-point. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Claims impacts of accountability outweigh risks, but doesn't provide comparative analysis of magnitude or probability. Asserts benefits without weighing against CON's stability concerns. Score: 2\n- CON: Explicitly weighs \"speculative promise of accountability\" against \"very real and immediate threat\" of destabilization. Compares timeframe and probability of impacts. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- CON consistently identifies a critical weakness in PRO's case: the subjective interpretation problem of distinguishing official from personal acts\n- PRO never adequately resolves this challenge, which is central to their proposal's workability\n- CON's Vienna Convention argument remains largely unrefuted beyond PRO calling it \"outdated\"\n- PRO's evidence remains largely assertion-based while CON grounds arguments in established international law framework\n- CON's weighing in final speech directly compares impacts while PRO simply asserts their impacts are greater\n\nThe scores remain stable across both passes.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nCON wins this debate through superior evidence grounding, more effective clash, and clearer impact weighing. The critical turning point is PRO's failure to resolve the \"who decides what is official vs. personal\" challenge, which undermines the workability of their core proposal. CON successfully defends the Vienna Convention framework and demonstrates concrete risks of limitation that PRO never adequately weighs against.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior evidence grounding in Vienna Convention framework, more effective refutation of PRO's official/personal distinction, and clearer comparative weighing of destabilization risks versus speculative accountability benefits.
