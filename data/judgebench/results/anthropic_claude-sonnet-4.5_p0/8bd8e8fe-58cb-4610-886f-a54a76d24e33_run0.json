  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (cognitive, economic, cultural) with logical structure and coherent flow. Arguments are well-developed and internally consistent. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents resource strain, linguistic diversity, and voluntary alternatives. Arguments are clear but somewhat repetitive across speeches. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific research (Dr. Bialystok's 2012 study with 4.5 year dementia delay), references ACTFL on economic benefits, provides concrete mechanisms. Score: 4\n- CON: Makes claims about \"over 350 languages\" and resource strain but provides no specific studies, data, or expert citations. Relies heavily on assertions. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses resource strain as \"false dilemma,\" refutes one-size-fits-all by explaining flexibility in implementation, challenges CON's dismissal of cognitive benefits with reference to scientific consensus. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's points but largely restates original position without substantively addressing PRO's rebuttals (e.g., doesn't respond to how bilingualism improves STEM, doesn't counter the Bialystok research). Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs long-term benefits against short-term costs, compares \"strategic investment\" vs \"diversion,\" frames choice as \"short-sighted concerns vs long-term prosperity.\" Score: 4\n- CON: Emphasizes \"immediate challenges\" and \"pressing reality\" but doesn't comparatively weigh against PRO's long-term impacts. Limited explicit weighing. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO's evidence advantage is substantial (specific study vs. general claims)\n- PRO's rebuttal effectively neutralizes CON's main arguments (resource strain as investment, flexibility addressing diversity)\n- CON's repeated assertion about \"not universally accepted\" cognitive benefits is never supported with counter-evidence\n- PRO's weighing of long-term vs. short-term is more explicit than CON's focus on immediate concerns\n\nScores remain stable.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Check\n\nWinner determination: PRO wins on superior evidence (specific research vs. assertions), more effective clash (directly addressed and refuted CON's main points), and clearer impact weighing (explicit comparison of timeframes and priorities). CON's resource strain argument, while intuitive, was effectively reframed as investment by PRO and never recovered.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 (Clear winner, though CON raised legitimate practical concerns that weren't completely dismissed)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding (Bialystok study, ACTFL data) and effective impact weighing of long-term benefits versus short-term costs. PRO successfully reframed CON's resource strain argument as strategic investment and demonstrated flexibility addressing linguistic diversity concerns. CON relied heavily on assertions without supporting evidence and failed to substantively engage PRO's cognitive research or comparative weighing.\"\n}\n```",
