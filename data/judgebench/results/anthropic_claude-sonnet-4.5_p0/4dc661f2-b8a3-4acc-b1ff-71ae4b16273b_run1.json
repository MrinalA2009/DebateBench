  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear structure with three main contentions (health outcomes, parental support, societal implications). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Equally clear structure with three contentions (government overreach, enforcement problems, educational benefits). Well-articulated and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites American Academy of Pediatrics with specific age-based recommendations. Links screen time to obesity, sleep issues, and mental health. Concrete support provided. Score: 4\n- CON: Less specific evidence but strong logical reasoning about enforcement challenges and individual differences. More conceptual than empirical. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Addresses autonomy concerns by reframing as \"support not infringement.\" Responds to enforcement by comparing to substance regulation. Engages opponent's points. Score: 4\n- CON: Directly challenges PRO's AAP guidelines as recommendations vs. laws. Points out contradiction in \"not one-size-fits-all\" while proposing legal mandate. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes public health crisis, child protection priority. Compares to substance abuse laws. Some comparative weighing. Score: 3\n- CON: Explicitly weighs \"governmental intrusion\" and \"erosion of parental rights\" against \"generalized concerns.\" Clear comparative framework in summary. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. **Guidelines vs. Laws**: CON effectively exploits PRO's reliance on AAP \"guidelines\" to argue they're recommendations, not mandates\n2. **Enforcement**: PRO's response (comparing to substance laws) doesn't adequately address CON's surveillance concerns\n3. **One-size-fits-all**: CON catches PRO's contradiction - claiming flexibility while proposing legal requirement\n4. **Parental autonomy**: PRO frames as support; CON frames as overreach - both positions maintained\n\nCON's rebuttal more effectively dismantles PRO's core logic by highlighting the inherent contradiction in a \"flexible legal mandate.\" CON's weighing in the summary is more explicit and comparative.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nThe decisive factor is CON's successful challenge to PRO's central tension: how can a legal requirement be both mandatory and flexible? PRO never resolves this contradiction. Additionally, CON's enforcement critique remains largely unaddressed - PRO's substance abuse analogy doesn't explain the practical mechanism for monitoring private screen time.\n\nCON wins on superior clash (exposing logical contradictions) and clearer impact weighing (explicit comparison of harms).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by effectively exposing the central contradiction in PRO's position\u2014that a legal mandate cannot be both flexible and legally binding.
