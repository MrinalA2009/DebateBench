  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through multiple passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured arguments about addiction (2M pathological, 4-6M problem gamblers), financial ruin, and regressive taxation. Arguments are logically connected and internally consistent. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers coherent counter-arguments about personal freedom, economic benefits ($41B tax revenue), and responsible regulation. However, some tension between acknowledging harm and dismissing it. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites National Council on Problem Gambling statistics, provides specific numbers (2M pathological gamblers), references social costs in \"tens of billions,\" mentions UK as example. Well-integrated support. Score: 4\n- CON: Cites American Gaming Association ($41B revenue figure), references UK regulation success, but provides less specific data on effectiveness of regulation or responsible gambling rates. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's personal choice argument (addiction compromises choice), challenges economic benefit claim (net loss when costs considered), refutes regulation effectiveness (UK still has problems). Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to addiction concerns (majority gamble responsibly), addresses economic criticism (willing participation), but doesn't effectively counter PRO's net cost calculation or regressive tax argument. Partial engagement. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly compares $41B revenue to \"tens of billions\" in social costs, frames as net loss, emphasizes magnitude of harm to vulnerable populations, prioritizes human well-being over revenue. Clear comparative weighing. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions economic benefits and personal freedom but doesn't directly weigh these against PRO's cost calculations or addiction impacts. Limited comparative analysis. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. **Personal choice vs. addiction**: PRO effectively argues addiction compromises choice; CON asserts majority gamble responsibly but doesn't quantify or prove this claim\n2. **Economic benefit**: PRO provides comparative weighing (revenue vs. social costs); CON doesn't address the net cost argument\n3. **Regulation vs. ban**: PRO argues regulation fails to address root cause; CON advocates regulation but doesn't prove its effectiveness against PRO's UK counterexample\n\nPRO consistently engages and refutes CON's major arguments while CON leaves key PRO arguments (net economic loss, regressive taxation) largely unaddressed.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking for dropped arguments:\n- PRO's \"tens of billions in social costs\" argument \u2192 CON never disputes this figure or provides counter-calculation\n- PRO's regressive taxation argument \u2192 CON acknowledges \"willing participation\" but doesn't address the disproportionate impact on low-income populations\n- CON's \"majority gamble responsibly\" claim \u2192 Not quantified or evidenced sufficiently to outweigh PRO's specific addiction statistics\n\nThe debate turns on comparative weighing: PRO establishes that even if economic benefits exist, they're outweighed by social costs. CON doesn't effectively challenge this calculus.\n\n**Confidence: 0.75** - Clear winner but CON made reasonable arguments that could resonate with some judges who prioritize personal freedom differently.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior impact weighing, directly comparing $41B revenue to tens of billions in social costs, establishing net economic loss.
