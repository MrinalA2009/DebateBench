  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear structure with three main contentions (climate science, implementation through carbon pricing, equity). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-structured response addressing economic impacts, equity concerns, and alternative solutions. Clear logical flow throughout. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific statistic (2.5% of global emissions, projected to triple by 2050). Provides mechanism (carbon pricing) but limited detail on implementation. Score: 3\n- CON: References specific examples (Airbus hydrogen aircraft, SAF development) and provides concrete alternatives. More detailed grounding of claims. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's economic arguments, addresses equity concerns, and responds to technology claims. However, doesn't fully address the regressive nature of carbon pricing. Score: 3\n- CON: Systematically dismantles PRO's equity argument, directly challenges carbon pricing mechanism, and addresses urgency claims. Strong engagement throughout. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Compares long-term climate costs vs. short-term economic impacts. Emphasizes urgency but doesn't quantify comparative harms. Score: 3\n- CON: Weighs economic devastation against minimal environmental gain, highlights disproportionate impact on developing nations, and compares aviation's small percentage to other sectors. More comparative analysis. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. **Equity argument**: CON effectively turned PRO's equity claim by showing carbon pricing creates two-tiered system\n2. **Urgency vs. innovation**: PRO claims urgency requires immediate action; CON counters that innovation is already happening and rationing causes disproportionate harm\n3. **Economic impact**: PRO argues climate costs outweigh economic concerns; CON demonstrates concrete economic devastation with minimal environmental benefit\n\nCON maintained consistent pressure on PRO's carbon pricing mechanism being regressive, which PRO never adequately resolved. CON's comparative weighing (small aviation percentage vs. massive economic impact) was more developed than PRO's urgency claims.\n\n## Final Consistency Check\n\nWinner determination: CON won on superior evidence (specific examples), stronger clash (turned equity argument), and better impact weighing (comparative analysis of costs/benefits). While both had similar argument quality, CON's refutation strategy was more effective.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 - Clear winner but PRO made reasonable arguments about urgency that weren't completely dismantled.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON won through superior impact weighing and effective refutation.
