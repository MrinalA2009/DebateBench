  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear, structured claims (division, authoritarianism, global cooperation obstruction). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers counterarguments about nationalism as unifying force, democratic foundation, and compatibility with cooperation. Arguments are clear but somewhat defensive. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific examples (US/UK polarization, Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, COVID-19 pandemic, McCarthyism). Examples are relevant and integrated into arguments. Score: 4\n- CON: References post-WWII US civil rights, European Union as examples. Less specific detail than PRO, more general assertions about \"healthy nationalism.\" Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's examples (challenges post-WWII narrative with McCarthyism, refutes EU example with COVID-19 hoarding). Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to PRO's points but often deflects (\"not inherent to nationalism,\" \"result of misuse\"). Less direct refutation of specific claims. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Consistently emphasizes magnitude (democratic erosion, global crisis management) and scope (transnational challenges). Clear comparative framing. Score: 4\n- CON: Argues for \"balance\" and \"nuance\" but doesn't clearly weigh why their impacts outweigh PRO's harms. Limited comparative analysis. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO maintains consistent offensive pressure with concrete examples\n- CON's \"nationalism isn't inherently bad\" argument doesn't adequately address PRO's evidence of actual harm\n- PRO's rebuttal effectively turns CON's post-WWII example\n- CON's reliance on \"misuse\" vs \"inherent\" distinction is not sufficiently developed to overcome PRO's empirical examples\n- PRO provides clearer impact calculus throughout\n\nWinner remains PRO with high confidence.\n\n## Final Consistency Check\n\nThe scoring is stable across passes. PRO wins on superior evidence integration, more effective clash, and clearer impact weighing. CON's theoretical defense of nationalism doesn't overcome PRO's concrete examples of harm.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence integration and impact weighing.
