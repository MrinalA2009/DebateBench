  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate through multiple passes to ensure consistency.\n\n## First Pass Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with three main contentions (effectiveness of reallocation, police exacerbating issues, systemic inequalities). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-structured response with three counter-arguments (proactive policing, immediate safety needs, reform vs defunding). Logical and clear. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites National Institute Justice ($1 saves $4), Treatment Advocacy Center report. Provides specific mechanisms and examples. Score: 4\n- CON: References community policing initiatives and crisis intervention training but lacks specific citations or data. More general assertions. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's points about police necessity, crisis response, and reform. Addresses each major argument. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to PRO's claims about over-policing and mental health, but some responses are more defensive than directly refutational. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Consistently emphasizes cost-effectiveness ($1 to $4 savings), better outcomes, and systemic change. Clear comparative framing. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions public safety and community trust but less explicit comparative weighing against PRO's impacts. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Analysis\n\nReviewing for consistency:\n\n**Key Debate Dynamics:**\n- PRO maintains consistent framing around root causes and cost-effectiveness\n- CON argues for balance but doesn't effectively counter PRO's specific evidence\n- PRO's $1 to $4 savings claim goes largely uncontested\n- CON's reform argument doesn't explain why reform requires current funding levels\n- PRO more effectively weighs magnitude (systemic change vs. incremental reform)\n\n**Critical Dropped Arguments:**\n- CON doesn't adequately respond to the cost-effectiveness evidence\n- PRO's claim about police escalating mental health crises is partially contested but not fully refuted\n- CON's community policing point is addressed by PRO's over-policing response\n\n## Final Consistency Check\n\nWinner determination: PRO wins on balance due to:\n1. Superior evidence grounding (specific citations vs general claims)\n2. More effective impact weighing (quantified savings, systemic scope)\n3. Better clash engagement in rebuttals\n4. CON's failure to contest key evidence claims\n\nConfidence: 0.72 - Clear winner but CON made reasonable structural arguments that weren't entirely overcome\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding, particularly the uncontested $1-to-$4 cost savings claim, and more effective impact weighing comparing systemic change to incremental reform.
