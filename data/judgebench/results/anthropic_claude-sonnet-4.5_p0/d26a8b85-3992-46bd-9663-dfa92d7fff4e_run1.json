  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (conflict/violence, impeding social progress, intellectual stagnation). Arguments are logically structured and internally consistent. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents two main contentions (moral framework/altruism, social cohesion). Arguments are coherent but less developed in the constructive. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Provides specific examples (ISIS, Boko Haram), references concrete issues (reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ discrimination, stem cell research). Well-integrated support. Score: 4\n- CON: References studies on charitable activities and disaster relief but lacks specific citations. More general assertions about religious contributions. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's \"misinterpretation\" argument, challenges the charity claim with conditional aid critique, addresses the social cohesion argument by noting it creates \"others.\" Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to PRO's charity critique and addresses the \"other\" argument, but doesn't effectively counter PRO's specific examples of religious violence or systematic oppression. Partial engagement. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs impacts in summary (\"widespread violence, human rights abuses, and suppression of critical thought...far outweigh the localized benefits\"). Clear comparative analysis of magnitude and scope. Score: 4\n- CON: Argues benefits outweigh harms but provides less specific comparative weighing. Claims billions benefit but doesn't directly compare magnitude of harms vs. benefits. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's central argument is that religious harms are systemic and inherent to dogmatic belief systems. They provide specific examples and directly challenge CON's defense that harms are merely misinterpretations.\n\nCON's defense relies heavily on the \"misinterpretation\" argument and positive contributions, but struggles to address PRO's specific examples of systematic oppression and violence. The \"billions benefit\" argument lacks comparative weighing against the harms PRO identifies.\n\nThe key clash is whether religious harms are inherent or aberrations. PRO more effectively argues the systemic nature of harm, while CON's \"exceptions\" defense actually concedes that harms exist but argues they're outweighed\u2014without providing sufficient comparative analysis.\n\nScores remain consistent with first pass.\n\n## Final Judgment\n\nPRO wins on stronger clash, more specific evidence, and superior impact weighing. CON's failure to adequately address the systemic nature of religious harm and provide comparative weighing is decisive.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior impact weighing and more effective clash.
