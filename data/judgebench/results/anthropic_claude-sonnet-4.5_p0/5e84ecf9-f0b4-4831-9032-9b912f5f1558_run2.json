  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear structure with specific claims about regulation reducing deaths, uses CDC statistics, and maintains logical flow. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Articulates Second Amendment rights, criminal behavior arguments, and root causes framework clearly. However, some circular reasoning (criminals don't follow laws, therefore laws don't work). Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites CDC data (39,000 deaths in 2019), Australia's 42% reduction in gun homicides, references Supreme Court rulings. Specific and relevant support. Score: 4\n- CON: References Second Amendment and Supreme Court but lacks specific data. Claims about Australia showing \"mixed results\" without evidence. Mostly reasoning-based rather than evidence-based. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses Second Amendment concerns, refutes the false dichotomy argument, engages with Australia comparison criticism. Effective engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to Second Amendment interpretation, challenges Australia comparison, addresses root causes argument. Good engagement but less specific in refutation. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs human lives lost (39,000 annually) against constitutional concerns. Clear magnitude comparison in summary. Score: 4\n- CON: Attempts weighing between \"superficial solutions\" and \"genuine safety\" but lacks quantification. More abstract weighing. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO consistently provides concrete evidence and directly engages opponent's arguments\n- CON relies heavily on theoretical arguments without empirical support\n- PRO's Australia evidence (42% reduction) is never effectively refuted with counter-evidence\n- CON's \"criminals don't follow laws\" argument is addressed by PRO but CON doesn't evolve the response\n- PRO maintains clearer impact calculus throughout\n\nScores remain stable.\n\n## Winner Determination\n\nPRO wins on:\n- Superior evidence quality (specific statistics vs. general claims)\n- More effective refutation (addresses opponent's framework while maintaining own)\n- Clearer impact weighing (quantified lives saved)\n\nCON's strongest argument (root causes) is neutralized by PRO's \"not mutually exclusive\" response, which CON never effectively counters.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 (Clear winner, though CON made reasonable constitutional arguments)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence quality, citing specific CDC statistics and Australia's 42% reduction in gun homicides. PRO effectively refuted CON's constitutional and root causes arguments while maintaining clearer impact weighing. CON relied primarily on theoretical claims without empirical support, and failed to counter PRO's 'not mutually exclusive' response regarding addressing both gun control and underlying social issues.\"\n}\n```",
