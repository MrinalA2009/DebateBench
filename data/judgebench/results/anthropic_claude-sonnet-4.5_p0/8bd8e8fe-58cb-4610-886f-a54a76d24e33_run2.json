  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (cognitive, economic, cultural) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents resource strain, linguistic diversity, and voluntary alternatives. Arguments are clear but somewhat repetitive across speeches. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific research (Dr. Bialystok's 2012 study, Brain and Language journal, ACTFL), provides concrete claims (4.5 year dementia delay, 350+ languages statistic used defensively). Score: 4\n- CON: Uses general claims about resource strain and linguistic diversity (350+ languages) but lacks specific studies or data to support assertions about cognitive benefits being disputed. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses resource strain as \"false dilemma,\" refutes one-size-fits-all by explaining flexibility in implementation, challenges CON's dismissal of cognitive benefits with reference to scientific consensus. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's arguments but largely reasserts original positions without deeply engaging PRO's rebuttals. Doesn't effectively counter the Bialystok research or explain why voluntary programs achieve better outcomes. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Frames debate as \"short-sighted concerns about immediate costs versus long-term prosperity,\" explicitly weighs long-term benefits against short-term costs, connects cognitive benefits to STEM performance. Score: 4\n- CON: Emphasizes \"immediate challenges\" and \"pressing reality\" but doesn't comparatively weigh why short-term resource concerns outweigh long-term benefits PRO establishes. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO's evidence advantage is substantial (specific studies vs. general assertions)\n- CON's resource strain argument is never quantified or proven to outweigh PRO's benefits\n- PRO effectively turns the \"one-size-fits-all\" criticism by explaining implementation flexibility\n- CON drops the dementia research and doesn't adequately challenge the economic competitiveness argument\n- PRO's weighing mechanism (long-term vs. short-term) is more developed than CON's\n\nWinner remains PRO with high confidence.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Check\n\nConfirming:\n- PRO wins on evidence (specific research vs. assertions)\n- PRO wins on clash (addresses all major CON arguments)\n- PRO wins on weighing (explicit comparative framework)\n- CON's strongest argument (resource strain) is never proven to outweigh established benefits\n- Scores remain stable across passes\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively through superior evidence (Bialystok study, ACTFL data) and effective weighing of long-term benefits against short-term costs. CON's resource strain argument lacks quantification and fails to outweigh PRO's established cognitive, economic, and social benefits. PRO successfully refutes the one-size-fits-all criticism by explaining implementation flexibility.\"\n}\n```",
