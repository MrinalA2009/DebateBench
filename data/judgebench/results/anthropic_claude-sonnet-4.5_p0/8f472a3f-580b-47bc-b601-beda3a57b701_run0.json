  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear thesis that nationalism creates \"us vs them\" mentality. Structured arguments about erosion of cooperation, social tensions, and xenophobia. Consistent framing throughout. Score: 4\n- CON: Clear counter-thesis about responsible nationalism. Three main points (identity/belonging, democratic governance, global cooperation compatibility). Well-organized. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References WWI/WWII, \"America First,\" Brexit, hate crimes. Some historical grounding but limited specific data. Score: 3\n- CON: References Canada's multiculturalism, voter turnout claims, climate cooperation examples. Similar level of specificity to PRO. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's unity argument, challenges civic engagement claim, refutes coexistence with cooperation. Strong engagement in rebuttal. Score: 4\n- CON: Addresses \"us vs them\" claim, provides Canada counter-example, challenges democratic undermining argument. Effective engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs negative consequences against benefits in summary. States \"negative consequences far outweigh potential benefits.\" Clear comparative weighing. Score: 4\n- CON: States constructive aspects \"outweigh negative consequences\" in summary. Provides weighing but less developed than PRO. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nRe-examining key clash points:\n1. **Minority marginalization**: PRO argues nationalism inevitably marginalizes minorities. CON counters with Canada example showing multiculturalism within nationalism. CON provides concrete counter-example, but PRO's \"inevitably\" claim remains largely unrefuted by one example.\n\n2. **Democratic governance**: CON claims nationalism enhances civic engagement. PRO argues it undermines democratic institutions through populism. PRO's rebuttal notes lack of evidence for CON's claim, which is accurate.\n\n3. **Global cooperation**: PRO argues nationalism conflicts with cooperation (climate crisis example). CON argues they can coexist. PRO's climate crisis example is more concrete than CON's theoretical claim.\n\n4. **Weighing**: PRO explicitly engages in comparative weighing in summary, calling CON's examples \"exceptions rather than the rule.\" CON provides weighing but less comparative analysis.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking for dropped arguments:\n- CON's Canada example is not fully addressed by PRO\n- PRO's climate crisis example is not directly refuted by CON\n- PRO's claim about \"exceptions vs. rule\" is not answered by CON\n\nOverall assessment: PRO maintains slightly stronger clash and weighing. PRO's argument that CON's examples are exceptions is a meta-level weighing argument that CON doesn't address. PRO's climate crisis example provides concrete grounding for the cooperation clash. The debate is close, but PRO edges ahead on weighing and slightly on clash.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.6,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on superior impact weighing, explicitly comparing negative consequences against benefits and arguing CON's examples are exceptions. PRO's climate crisis example provides concrete grounding for cooperation clash. CON's Canada counter-example is strong but insufficient to overcome PRO's meta-level 'exceptions vs. rule' argument, which remains unaddressed in final speeches.\"\n}\n```",
