  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear pillars (environment, equity, resources) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Provides structured counter-arguments with economic data, environmental context, and equity rebuttal. Well-developed reasoning. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific study (14x CO2 emissions), provides concrete comparison to commercial flights. However, limited depth beyond this key statistic. Score: 3\n- CON: Provides specific economic data ($247B, 1.2M jobs from NBAA), contextualizes aviation emissions (2.5% global), mentions SAFs and electric aircraft development. More comprehensive grounding. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's economic argument, challenges the dismissal of environmental impact, responds to equity claims. Solid engagement but somewhat repetitive. Score: 4\n- CON: Systematically addresses each PRO argument, challenges speculative claims about green jobs, defends innovation argument, questions practicality of equity claims. Strong, direct refutation. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes climate urgency and accountability across sectors, but doesn't comparatively weigh against economic impacts raised by CON. Limited comparative analysis. Score: 3\n- CON: Explicitly weighs immediate economic harm (1.2M jobs) against speculative benefits, compares private jet emissions to total aviation sector, argues ban removes innovation incentive. More comparative weighing. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- CON effectively challenges PRO's assumption that banning creates green jobs (speculative vs. concrete harm)\n- PRO's environmental argument (14x emissions) stands but CON contextualizes it within broader aviation sector\n- CON's economic data remains largely uncontested in magnitude\n- PRO doesn't adequately respond to CON's innovation argument (SAFs, electric aircraft)\n- CON provides more comparative impact analysis\n\nThe key clash points favor CON on economic impacts and innovation, while PRO maintains environmental urgency but without sufficient comparative weighing against CON's economic arguments.\n\n## Final Judgment\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior evidence grounding and impact weighing. While both sides clashed effectively, CON provided concrete economic data that PRO never adequately weighed against, and successfully argued that innovation incentives would be lost. CON's contextualization of private jet emissions within the broader aviation sector and emphasis on technological solutions over punitive bans proved more compelling than PRO's moral framing without comparative analysis.\"\n}\n```",
