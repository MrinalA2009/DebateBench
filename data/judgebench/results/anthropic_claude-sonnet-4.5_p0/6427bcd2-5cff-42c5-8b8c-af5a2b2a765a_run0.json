  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (empowerment/dignity, informed decisions, public trust). Arguments are well-structured and logically coherent throughout. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers three counter-arguments (inconsistency/bias, rehabilitation concerns, victim trauma). Arguments are clear but somewhat less developed in the constructive. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References \"research shows\" victim satisfaction and closure, claims about rehabilitation effectiveness. Some assertions lack specific grounding but provides mechanisms. Score: 3\n- CON: Also references \"research suggests\" regarding rehabilitation factors. Similar level of general support without specific citations. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses all three CON concerns in rebuttal (bias, rehabilitation, trauma). Engages point-by-point effectively. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to PRO's rebuttal arguments, challenges assumptions about objectivity and rehabilitation claims. Good engagement but slightly less comprehensive. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes dignity restoration, system integrity, and healing. Makes comparative claims about benefits outweighing risks. Score: 3\n- CON: Focuses on fairness, rehabilitation principles, and systemic integrity. Explicitly weighs risks against benefits in summary. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- PRO establishes three benefits, CON counters with three risks\n- PRO's rebuttal addresses each CON point directly\n- CON's rebuttal challenges PRO's assumptions about victim objectivity\n- Both sides maintain consistent positions\n\nKey clash points:\n1. **Bias concern**: CON argues victims seek revenge vs. PRO argues current system already has bias\n2. **Rehabilitation**: CON says punishment level doesn't drive rehabilitation vs. PRO says accountability from victim impact does\n3. **Victim wellbeing**: CON emphasizes trauma risk vs. PRO emphasizes empowerment with support\n\nCON's strongest point is the challenge to victim objectivity and the revenge vs. justice distinction. PRO's response that the current system has bias doesn't fully address whether adding victim input increases inconsistency.\n\nHowever, PRO more effectively turns CON's rehabilitation argument by explaining the mechanism (accountability through understanding impact), while CON's counter relies more on assertion.\n\n## Final Scores and Decision\n\nPRO maintains slightly better engagement throughout and provides more mechanistic explanations for how victim input improves outcomes. CON raises important concerns but doesn't fully develop why these outweigh PRO's benefits beyond assertion.\n\nThe debate is close, but PRO edges ahead on clash and providing clearer mechanisms for their claims.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.55,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins narrowly by providing clearer mechanisms for how victim input improves rehabilitation through accountability and by more directly engaging CON's concerns.
