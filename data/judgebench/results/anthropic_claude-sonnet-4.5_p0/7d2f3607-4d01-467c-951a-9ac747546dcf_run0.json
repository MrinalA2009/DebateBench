  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear pillars (environment, equity, resources) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Provides structured counter-arguments with economic focus, innovation discussion, and equity rebuttal. Well-developed but slightly repetitive. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific study (14x CO2 emissions), provides concrete comparison to commercial flights. Evidence is relevant and integrated. Score: 4\n- CON: Provides specific economic data ($247B, 1.2M jobs from NBAA), mentions SAFs and electric aircraft development. Strong quantitative support. Score: 5\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's economic arguments, addresses innovation claims, responds to equity points. Good engagement but some responses are more assertive than substantive. Score: 3\n- CON: Systematically addresses each PRO argument, challenges speculative claims, points out logical gaps (e.g., \"separate policy goal\"). More thorough refutation. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes climate urgency and \"every sector must contribute,\" but limited comparative analysis of why environmental impact outweighs economic harm. Score: 3\n- CON: Compares immediate economic damage vs. speculative benefits, contextualizes private jets as \"minuscule fraction\" of emissions, weighs innovation potential. More explicit comparative weighing. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. Economic impact: CON provides concrete numbers; PRO's \"green jobs\" response is speculative\n2. Environmental impact: PRO establishes 14x multiplier; CON contextualizes as small fraction of total emissions\n3. Innovation: CON argues ban removes incentive for SAFs/electric aircraft; PRO doesn't effectively counter this mechanism\n4. Equity: Both sides assert positions but neither provides strong weighing\n\nCON's advantage: More concrete evidence, better comparative weighing, stronger refutation of opponent's mechanisms.\n\n## Final Consistency Check\n\nWinner should be CON because:\n- Superior evidence grounding with specific economic data\n- More effective clash, particularly on innovation mechanism\n- Better impact weighing (immediate vs. speculative, contextualizing emissions)\n- PRO's environmental argument is strong but doesn't overcome CON's economic/innovation framework\n\nConfidence: 0.70 (Clear winner but PRO had legitimate environmental concerns that weren't fully outweighed)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 5\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.70,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior evidence grounding with concrete economic data and more effective impact weighing. CON successfully contextualized private jets as minimal emissions fraction while demonstrating immediate economic harm versus PRO's speculative benefits. CON's innovation mechanism argument\u2014that bans remove incentive for sustainable aviation development\u2014went largely unrefuted, providing decisive comparative advantage despite PRO's legitimate environmental concerns.\"\n}\n```",
