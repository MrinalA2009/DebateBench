  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with three contentions (conflict, exploitation, shared heritage). Arguments are logically coherent and well-developed. Score: 4\n- CON: Also presents clear structure (innovation, cooperation, stewardship), but the rebuttal appears to argue against their own position, creating confusion. Score: 2\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Uses historical examples (scramble for Africa, resource wars), references Outer Space Treaty, provides mechanisms (helium-3 example). Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions SpaceX/Blue Origin, Antarctic research model, but provides less detailed support. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's three main points, provides specific counterarguments about inequality, historical precedent, and profit motives. Score: 4\n- CON: The rebuttal section is problematic - it appears to argue FOR the resolution rather than against it, essentially conceding PRO's points. Score: 1\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly articulates impacts (conflict, inequality, environmental degradation) and explains why these outweigh potential benefits. Score: 4\n- CON: Minimal comparative weighing; doesn't explain why innovation benefits outweigh conflict risks. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the CON rebuttal and summary: CON's rebuttal states \"the potential for conflict, inequality, and environmental degradation far outweighs any hypothetical benefits of ownership\" - this is arguing FOR the resolution, not against it. This is a critical error that essentially concedes the debate.\n\nPRO consistently maintains their position, directly refutes CON's points, and provides comparative analysis throughout.\n\n## Final Judgment\n\nThe debate outcome is clear: CON made a fatal error in their rebuttal by arguing for PRO's position, effectively conceding the major points of clash. PRO maintained consistent argumentation, provided better evidence, and dominated the weighing debate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 1\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively.
