  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (fairness, economic stability, service quality) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Also presents three clear contentions (worker autonomy, consumer choice, economic viability) with good structure. Arguments are logical and well-developed. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Economic Policy Institute and references research on bias in tipping. Uses general studies but could be more specific. Score: 3\n- CON: Cites specific 2019 Cornell University study. Provides concrete examples of high-volume establishments. Slightly more specific grounding. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's Cornell study, challenges the accountability argument, and responds to economic burden claims with turnover/training cost arguments. Good engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Effectively challenges PRO's bias solution, questions the mechanism for eliminating prejudice, disputes service quality claims, and challenges customer willingness to pay. Strong direct engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Discusses magnitude (inequality affects marginalized groups), mentions economic benefits, but limited comparative weighing of why their impacts outweigh CON's concerns. Score: 3\n- CON: Emphasizes immediate harm to workers' earning potential, consumer accountability loss, and business viability. Provides some comparative analysis (short-term vs long-term costs). Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's strongest point is the systemic bias argument, which CON doesn't fully refute - CON admits bias exists but argues changing payment won't eliminate it, which somewhat concedes PRO's fairness concern.\n\nCON's strongest point is the earning potential argument for skilled workers, which PRO doesn't adequately address - PRO focuses on marginalized workers but doesn't explain why high-earning servers should lose income.\n\nBoth sides engage well, but CON more effectively challenges PRO's mechanisms (how will flat wages eliminate bias? how will customers express dissatisfaction?), while PRO's challenges to CON are somewhat answered (bias exists regardless, accountability through tips is valuable).\n\nThe economic burden argument is contested but not decisively won by either side.\n\n## Final Scores\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.6,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins narrowly through stronger evidence grounding and more effective mechanism challenges. While PRO establishes fairness concerns, CON successfully questions how abolishing tipping solves bias while demonstrating concrete harms to high-earning workers and consumer accountability. CON's Cornell study and specific examples of earning potential provide slightly better evidentiary support than PRO's general references.\"\n}\n```",
