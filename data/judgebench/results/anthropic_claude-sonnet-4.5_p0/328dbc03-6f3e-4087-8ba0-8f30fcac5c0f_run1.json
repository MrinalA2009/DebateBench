  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with two main contentions (physical health, cognitive/socio-emotional development). Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Also well-structured around parental autonomy and complexity of screen use. Clear logical flow. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites AAP recommendations, 2019 JAMA Pediatrics study, NIH research. Specific examples and mechanisms provided. Score: 4\n- CON: References Joan Ganz Cooney Center study, but less specific evidence overall. More reliant on logical reasoning than empirical support. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's autonomy argument with car seat/vaccination analogy. Addresses the \"not all screen time is equal\" point. Refutes relationship damage claim. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's arguments but less directly. Calls car seat comparison \"misleading\" but doesn't fully develop why. Some engagement with harm claims. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes \"public health crisis,\" \"entire generation,\" healthcare burden. Compares to established safety laws. Clear magnitude framing. Score: 4\n- CON: Focuses on autonomy and unintended consequences but less comparative weighing of impacts. Doesn't directly weigh autonomy against health harms. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's key strength: Establishes concrete harms (obesity, sleep, development) with evidence, then successfully defends against autonomy objections by comparing to existing child safety laws. The car seat/vaccination analogy is powerful and CON's dismissal as \"misleading\" lacks sufficient development.\n\nCON's key weakness: While raising valid concerns about autonomy and educational benefits, fails to adequately weigh these against PRO's demonstrated health harms. The claim that legal requirements would damage relationships is speculative (as CON admits PRO's counter is also speculative, creating a wash).\n\nThe critical dropped argument: CON never effectively answers why parental autonomy should override demonstrated public health harms when we already accept similar limitations for other child safety issues.\n\n## Final Scores Confirmation\n\n- Argument Quality: PRO 4, CON 4 (both clear and coherent)\n- Evidence: PRO 4, CON 3 (PRO has more specific citations)\n- Clash: PRO 4, CON 3 (PRO more directly engages)\n- Weighing: PRO 4, CON 2 (PRO clearly prioritizes impacts)\n\nWinner: PRO wins on superior evidence, clash, and especially impact weighing. The car seat analogy effectively neutralizes the autonomy argument, and CON fails to comparatively weigh their concerns against established harms.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 (Clear winner, though CON raised legitimate concerns about implementation)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding and impact weighing.
