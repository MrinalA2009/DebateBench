  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate through multiple passes to ensure consistency.\n\n## First Pass Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure, focuses on ecosystem destruction and risks. Arguments are coherent but somewhat repetitive. Score: 3\n- CON: Well-structured with two clear contentions (mineral demand, regulatory frameworks). More strategic framing. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites NOAA report (90% species loss), European Commission report on recycling. Limited specific evidence. Score: 3\n- CON: References IEA projections, ISA regulatory work, specific minerals and technologies. More concrete grounding. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Engages with CON's arguments about technology and regulation, challenges the necessity claim. Moderate engagement. Score: 3\n- CON: Directly addresses PRO's alternatives argument, challenges recycling sufficiency, responds to regulatory concerns. Stronger engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes long-term ecosystem preservation, but doesn't comparatively weigh against energy transition needs. Score: 2\n- CON: Explicitly weighs climate change as \"far greater environmental threat,\" compares terrestrial vs deep-sea mining impacts. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key moments:\n- CON establishes necessity through IEA demand projections\n- PRO's recycling alternative is challenged as insufficient by CON\n- CON's regulatory framework argument is contested but not effectively refuted by PRO\n- PRO drops the comparative impact weighing (climate change vs ecosystem loss)\n- CON consistently frames the debate as \"balanced approach\" vs \"unrealistic prohibition\"\n\nThe scores remain stable across passes.\n\n## Final Decision\n\nCON wins through superior impact weighing and more effective clash. CON established that deep-sea mining addresses climate change (framed as greater threat) while PRO failed to prove alternatives are sufficient or to comparatively weigh ecosystem preservation against energy transition needs. CON's regulatory mitigation argument was contested but not defeated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing, framing climate change as a greater threat than ecosystem disruption.
