  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically through multiple passes to ensure consistency.\n\n## First Pass Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure, coherent claims about convenience, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. Arguments are well-organized and logical. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-structured arguments about diagnostic accuracy, personal connection, and health disparities. Clear and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites American Telemedicine Association (75% satisfaction), National Institute of Health (30% cost reduction), Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare. Specific statistics provided. Score: 4\n- CON: References Journal of the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association. Less specific statistics but credible sources. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses physical examination concerns, personal connection arguments, and digital divide. Provides counterarguments and acknowledges limitations while reframing. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's convenience claims but somewhat repetitive. Maintains position but less dynamic engagement with PRO's cost-effectiveness arguments. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs accessibility, cost reduction (30%), and patient satisfaction against concerns. Frames telemedicine as supplementary, not complete replacement. Score: 4\n- CON: Emphasizes diagnostic accuracy and equity but less comparative weighing of magnitude. Focuses on qualitative importance without quantitative comparison. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing for consistency:\n- PRO consistently provides specific data points and engages with CON's concerns\n- CON maintains strong principled arguments but relies more on general assertions\n- PRO's rebuttal effectively reframes the debate (supplement vs. replace)\n- CON's repetition of similar points without new evidence is notable\n- PRO addresses the digital divide proactively while CON uses it defensively\n\n## Final Assessment\n\nPRO wins through superior evidence integration, more effective clash, and better comparative weighing. PRO's 30% cost reduction claim and 75% satisfaction rate provide concrete impacts. PRO also successfully reframes the resolution as supplementary rather than complete replacement, which CON doesn't adequately challenge. CON's arguments about physical examinations and personal connection are valid but lack the quantitative grounding and comparative analysis that PRO provides.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence integration with specific statistics (30% cost reduction, 75% satisfaction), more effective engagement with CON's concerns, and better comparative weighing of impacts.
