  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n**FIRST PASS EVALUATION:**\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear thesis about systemic issues in policing and need for reallocation. Uses CAHOOTS as concrete example. Arguments are coherent and well-structured. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents clear counter-position about public safety risks. Uses Minneapolis example. Arguments are logical and well-organized. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Eugene/CAHOOTS program with specific outcomes (reduced police interactions, improved trust). References studies about police budgets and mental health crises, though not deeply detailed. Score: 4\n- CON: Cites Minneapolis 2020 crime surge as evidence. References need for immediate response capabilities. Less specific detail than PRO on mechanisms. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses Minneapolis example, noting lack of comprehensive plan. Challenges CON's claim about social services lacking response capabilities. Engages with the \"balanced approach\" argument. Score: 4\n- CON: Addresses Eugene example by noting police weren't eliminated. Challenges PRO's claim about police escalation. Responds to root causes argument. Good engagement but slightly less direct. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Frames choice as resource allocation priority, argues for addressing \"root causes\" vs. punitive measures. Discusses magnitude (safer, more equitable communities) and moral obligation. Score: 3\n- CON: Emphasizes public safety as paramount concern. Discusses crime surge risks and danger of inadequate response. Less comparative weighing of why their impacts outweigh PRO's. Score: 3\n\n**SECOND PASS VERIFICATION:**\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO maintains consistent narrative about systemic reform with concrete example (CAHOOTS)\n- CON effectively challenges with Minneapolis but PRO rebuts by noting lack of comprehensive plan\n- PRO's evidence is slightly more specific and mechanistic\n- Both engage in clash, but PRO more directly addresses opponent's examples\n- Weighing is relatively balanced, both sides make impact claims\n\n**THIRD PASS - FINAL CHECK:**\n\nKey deciding factors:\n1. PRO provides more specific evidence (CAHOOTS program with described outcomes)\n2. PRO more effectively rebuts CON's Minneapolis example by contextualizing it\n3. CON's argument that Eugene \"maintained police presence\" doesn't fully counter PRO's point about reallocation\n4. PRO addresses the \"limited resources\" reality more directly\n5. Both have similar weighing, slight edge to PRO on framing\n\nThe debate is close, but PRO edges ahead on evidence specificity and clash effectiveness.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on stronger evidence and clash.
