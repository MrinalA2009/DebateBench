  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents two clear contentions (wage instability and discrimination/harassment) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-developed. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers multiple points (service incentives, income flexibility, unintended consequences) but some arguments contradict each other or lack full development. The rebuttal appears to accidentally argue PRO's position in places. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific studies (One Fair Wage 2021, ROC United) with concrete claims (tipped workers twice as likely to experience poverty). Evidence is integrated and relevant. Score: 4\n- CON: References Cornell University study and National Restaurant Association but with less specificity. Claims about successful tipping systems lack concrete support. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's arguments about service incentives and flexibility, reframing them as problems rather than benefits. Addresses job loss concerns. Score: 4\n- CON: The rebuttal is problematic - it appears to argue against tipping rather than for it, creating confusion. Limited effective engagement with PRO's discrimination argument. Score: 2\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly weighs poverty reduction, harassment prevention, and economic stability against CON's concerns. Explicitly compares \"unpredictable generosity\" vs \"stable wage.\" Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions customer satisfaction and worker preference but doesn't comparatively weigh these against PRO's impacts of poverty and harassment. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- CON's rebuttal contains a critical error where it argues PRO's position (\"this system can lead to inconsistent service quality\" and \"unpredictability of tips creates financial instability\")\n- PRO consistently maintains clash and responds to each CON argument\n- PRO's evidence is more specific and verifiable\n- PRO provides clearer impact comparison (poverty, harassment vs. service quality)\n\nThe scores remain stable.\n\n## Final Decision\n\nPRO wins clearly through superior clash, evidence, and weighing. The most decisive factor is CON's confused rebuttal that argues against their own position, combined with PRO's consistent engagement and clear impact prioritization (poverty and harassment prevention outweigh service quality concerns).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior clash and impact weighing.
