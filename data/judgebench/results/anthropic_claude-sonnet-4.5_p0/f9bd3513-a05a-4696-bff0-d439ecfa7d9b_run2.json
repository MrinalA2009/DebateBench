  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate through multiple passes to ensure consistency.\n\n## First Pass Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with three main contentions (effectiveness of reallocation, police exacerbating issues, systemic inequalities). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-structured response with three counter-arguments (proactive policing, immediate safety needs, reform vs. defunding). Logical and clear. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites National Institute Justice ($1 saves $4), Treatment Advocacy Center report. Provides specific mechanisms. Score: 4\n- CON: References community policing initiatives and crisis intervention training but lacks specific citations or data. More general assertions. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's points about police necessity, crisis response, and reform. Addresses each major argument. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to PRO's claims about over-policing and mental health, but some responses are more defensive than offensive. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Consistently emphasizes cost-effectiveness ($1 to $4 savings), better outcomes, and systemic equity. Clear comparative framing. Score: 4\n- CON: Discusses public safety but doesn't clearly weigh why maintaining police funding outweighs PRO's impacts. Less comparative analysis. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Analysis\n\nReviewing for consistency:\n\n**Argument Quality:** Both sides maintain clarity throughout. PRO's framework is slightly more cohesive in linking defunding to outcomes. Scores remain 4-4.\n\n**Evidence:** PRO's specific citations (NIJ, Treatment Advocacy Center) versus CON's general references to \"studies\" and training programs. PRO has stronger grounding. Scores: PRO 4, CON 3.\n\n**Clash:** PRO systematically addresses CON's three main points in rebuttal. CON engages but doesn't fully answer PRO's cost-effectiveness argument or the specific evidence about mental health professionals. Scores: PRO 4, CON 3.\n\n**Weighing:** PRO provides clear comparative metrics (cost savings, better outcomes). CON argues for balance but doesn't explain why their impacts outweigh PRO's quantified benefits. Scores: PRO 4, CON 3.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nPRO wins on evidence (specific citations vs. general claims), clash (more direct engagement), and weighing (clearer comparative analysis). Argument quality is roughly equal. CON's main weakness is lack of specific evidence and failure to directly weigh against PRO's cost-effectiveness claims.\n\nWinner: PRO\nConfidence: 0.72 (clear but contestable - CON made reasonable arguments but lacked the evidentiary support and comparative weighing to overcome PRO's case)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence and weighing.
