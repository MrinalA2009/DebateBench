  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with two main contentions (physical health, cognitive/socio-emotional development). Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Also well-structured around parental autonomy and complexity of screen use. Arguments are clear but slightly less developed in mechanistic explanation. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites AAP recommendations, 2019 JAMA Pediatrics study, NIH research with specific findings. Evidence is integrated and relevant. Score: 4\n- CON: References Joan Ganz Cooney Center study but provides less specific data. More reliant on logical reasoning than empirical support. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's autonomy argument with car seat/vaccination analogy. Addresses the \"not all screen time is equal\" point by clarifying the resolution allows for limits, not bans. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Challenges the car seat analogy as misleading, addresses the empowerment claim as speculative. Good engagement but less comprehensive in addressing PRO's health evidence. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes magnitude (entire generation's health), compares to existing legal precedents, frames as public health crisis. Clear prioritization of child welfare over autonomy. Score: 4\n- CON: Focuses on unintended consequences and relationship damage, but doesn't directly weigh these against PRO's health impacts. Less comparative weighing. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's key strength: Establishes concrete harms (obesity, sleep, development) with specific evidence, then successfully defends against autonomy concerns by drawing parallels to accepted legal interventions.\n\nCON's key weakness: While raising valid concerns about autonomy and one-size-fits-all approaches, fails to adequately weigh these against the specific health harms PRO establishes. The \"not all screen time is equal\" argument is partially conceded by PRO (who clarifies they support limits, not bans), weakening CON's position.\n\nCritical moment: PRO's car seat/vaccination analogy effectively neutralizes the autonomy argument by showing precedent for legal limits on parental choice when child welfare is at stake. CON calls this \"misleading\" but doesn't explain why screen time harms are fundamentally different from those safety measures.\n\n## Final Scores Confirmation\n\n- Argument Quality: PRO 4, CON 4 (both clear and coherent)\n- Evidence: PRO 4, CON 3 (PRO has more specific studies)\n- Clash: PRO 4, CON 3 (PRO more comprehensively engages)\n- Weighing: PRO 4, CON 2 (PRO clearly prioritizes impacts)\n\nWinner: PRO wins on superior evidence grounding, more effective clash, and clearer impact weighing. The debate hinges on whether autonomy concerns outweigh demonstrated health harms, and PRO successfully establishes both the harms and precedent for intervention.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 (Clear winner, though CON raised legitimate concerns about implementation)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins by establishing concrete health harms with specific evidence and successfully neutralizing autonomy concerns through legal precedent analogies.
