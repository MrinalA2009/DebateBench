  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear structure with three main contentions (climate science, implementation through carbon pricing, equity). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-structured response addressing economic impacts, equity concerns, and alternative solutions. Clear logical flow with specific counterarguments. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific statistic (2.5% of global emissions, projected to triple by 2050). Provides mechanism (carbon pricing) but limited detail on implementation. Score: 3\n- CON: References specific examples (Airbus hydrogen aircraft, SAF production). Provides concrete alternatives with real-world grounding. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's economic and equity arguments. Addresses technological innovation critique but somewhat dismissively. Score: 3\n- CON: Systematically refutes PRO's equity claim, challenges the carbon pricing mechanism as regressive, directly engages with urgency argument. More thorough engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Compares long-term climate costs vs. short-term economic costs. Addresses urgency and immediacy. Limited comparative analysis of magnitude. Score: 3\n- CON: Weighs economic devastation against minimal environmental gain. Compares rationing's impact on developing nations vs. innovation's potential. More explicit comparative weighing. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. **Equity argument**: CON effectively turns PRO's equity claim by showing carbon pricing creates two-tiered system\n2. **Urgency vs. Innovation**: PRO argues for immediate action; CON shows innovation is already happening (not distant)\n3. **Economic impact**: PRO claims long-term benefits; CON demonstrates immediate devastating consequences with specific examples\n\nCON's rebuttal more effectively undermines PRO's case by:\n- Turning the equity argument (carbon pricing helps wealthy, not poor)\n- Providing concrete alternatives rather than just critique\n- Demonstrating rationing's disproportionate harm relative to benefit\n\n## Final Consistency Check\n\nWinner determination: CON wins on balance by:\n- Superior evidence with specific examples\n- More effective refutation (turning equity argument)\n- Clearer impact weighing (economic devastation vs. minimal gain)\n- Better engagement with opponent's core claims\n\nConfidence: 0.72 (Clear winner but PRO made reasonable arguments on urgency)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by effectively turning PRO's equity argument, demonstrating carbon pricing creates regressive two-tiered system.
