  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (empowerment/dignity, informed decisions, public trust). Arguments are well-structured and logically coherent throughout. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers three counter-arguments (inconsistency/bias, rehabilitation concerns, victim trauma). Arguments are clear but slightly less developed in the constructive. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References \"research shows\" victim satisfaction and closure, cites rehabilitation studies in rebuttal. Provides mechanisms for how victim input improves outcomes. Score: 3\n- CON: Makes claims about bias and rehabilitation but provides less specific grounding. States \"research suggests\" in rebuttal but less concrete than PRO. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses all three CON arguments in rebuttal (bias concern, rehabilitation, trauma). Provides counter-evidence and alternative framing. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's rehabilitation claim and context argument. Questions objectivity of victims. Less comprehensive engagement with all PRO points (doesn't fully address public trust argument). Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Consistently frames impacts around dignity, healing, system integrity. In summary, explicitly weighs benefits against concerns raised by CON. Score: 4\n- CON: Emphasizes fairness and rehabilitation as priorities. In summary, attempts comparative weighing (\"outweighed by\") but less developed throughout debate. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing for consistency:\n- PRO maintains stronger engagement throughout, addressing opponent's concerns directly\n- CON's arguments about bias are theoretical but not as well-supported\n- PRO's rehabilitation counter (offenders understanding consequences) is a strong turn\n- CON drops the public trust argument entirely\n- PRO provides more concrete mechanisms for how their proposal works\n\n## Final Evaluation\n\nPRO wins on superior clash and weighing. While both sides present coherent arguments, PRO more effectively engages with opposition points and provides comparative analysis. The dropped public trust argument and PRO's effective turn on rehabilitation (victim input promotes rather than hinders it) are decisive factors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior clash and weighing.
