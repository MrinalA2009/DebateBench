  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (fairness, economic stability, service quality) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Also presents three clear contentions (worker autonomy, consumer choice, economic viability) with good structure. Arguments are logical and well-developed. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Economic Policy Institute and references research on bias in tipping. Uses general studies but could be more specific. Score: 3\n- CON: Cites specific 2019 Cornell University study. Provides concrete examples of high-volume establishments. Slightly more specific grounding. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's Cornell study, challenges the accountability argument, and responds to economic burden claims. Good engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Directly refutes PRO's bias argument, challenges the service quality claim, and contests the economic feasibility. Strong engagement with opponent's points. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Attempts to weigh fairness and stability benefits, mentions long-term business benefits. Some comparative analysis but could be stronger. Score: 3\n- CON: Emphasizes immediate economic harm to businesses, discusses merit-based system benefits, and highlights consumer accountability loss. Provides clearer comparative weighing of short-term vs. long-term impacts. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's strongest point is the systemic bias argument, which CON doesn't fully resolve - CON admits bias exists but argues changing payment won't fix it, which is somewhat evasive.\n\nCON's strongest point is the economic burden on businesses and the earning potential for skilled workers, which PRO addresses but doesn't fully overcome - the \"customers willing to pay more\" claim is indeed speculative.\n\nCON more effectively challenges PRO's mechanisms (how will flat wages eliminate bias? how will service improve without incentives?) while PRO's challenges to CON are somewhat answered (Cornell study does show higher earnings; accountability mechanism is real).\n\nThe weighing favors CON slightly - they emphasize immediate, concrete harms (business closures, job losses, income caps) versus PRO's longer-term, more speculative benefits (reduced turnover, customer willingness to pay more).\n\n## Final Scores Confirmation\n\n- Argument Quality: PRO 4, CON 4 (tied - both well-structured)\n- Evidence: PRO 3, CON 4 (CON slightly more specific)\n- Clash: PRO 4, CON 4 (both engaged well)\n- Weighing: PRO 3, CON 4 (CON provided clearer impact comparison)\n\nWinner: CON by narrow margin due to stronger evidence grounding and superior impact weighing, particularly on economic viability concerns.\n\nConfidence: 0.65 (clear but contestable - PRO made strong arguments on fairness that weren't fully resolved)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior impact weighing and evidence grounding.
