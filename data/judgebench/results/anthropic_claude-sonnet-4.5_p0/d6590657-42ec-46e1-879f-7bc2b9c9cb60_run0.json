  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (common heritage, conflict prevention, scientific advancement). Arguments are coherent and well-structured. Score: 4\n- CON: Also presents three clear contentions (investment incentives, resource security, human expansion). Equally coherent structure. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References Outer Space Treaty (1967), International Space Station as example, mentions historical patterns of territorial disputes. Moderate grounding. Score: 3\n- CON: Points to OST's \"stagnation,\" references capital-intensive nature of space exploration, draws parallels to maritime/air law. Similar level of support. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: In rebuttal, directly addresses CON's investment argument, challenges resource security claim, counters expansion argument with ISS example. Good engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Strongly rebuts monopolization concerns, addresses conflict argument with legal framework solution, distinguishes ISS from economic models. Very direct engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes inequality, global challenges (climate change, poverty), collective interests vs individual ambitions. Some comparative weighing but could be stronger. Score: 3\n- CON: Weighs stagnation vs progress, survival concerns (finite resources), multi-planetary species goal. Frames choice as \"stagnation vs innovation.\" Slightly more explicit weighing. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's core weakness: Doesn't adequately respond to CON's stagnation argument or explain how collaboration alone will generate necessary investment. The ISS example is government-funded, which CON effectively distinguishes from economic sustainability.\n\nCON's core strength: Successfully reframes the debate as stagnation vs progress, addresses PRO's conflict concerns with legal framework solution, and highlights that current treaty hasn't produced desired results.\n\nKey dropped argument: PRO doesn't effectively counter CON's point that the Outer Space Treaty has led to stagnation in large-scale development.\n\n## Final Scores Confirmation\n\n- Argument Quality: PRO 4, CON 4 (tied - both well-structured)\n- Evidence: PRO 3, CON 3 (tied - similar support levels)\n- Clash: PRO 4, CON 4 (both engaged effectively)\n- Weighing: PRO 3, CON 4 (CON provided clearer comparative framework)\n\nWinner: CON wins on superior impact weighing and more effective handling of the stagnation argument, which PRO largely conceded.\n\nConfidence: 0.65 (Clear but contestable - very close debate with one category difference)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior impact weighing, effectively framing the debate as stagnation versus progress.
