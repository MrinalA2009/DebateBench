  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured contentions about systemic discrimination, enforcement mechanisms, and economic benefits. Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Raises concerns about unintended consequences and complexity, but arguments are somewhat repetitive and less developed. The \"voluntary initiatives\" alternative is mentioned but not fully fleshed out. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific statistics (82 cents on the dollar), references AAUW 2020 study, and provides Iceland as a concrete example. Evidence is integrated into arguments effectively. Score: 4\n- CON: References NBER study but acknowledges it's about minimum wage (different mechanism). Lacks specific data or examples to support claims about job losses from pay equity mandates specifically. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's job loss argument, challenges the \"personal choices\" framing, and points out the insufficiency of voluntary measures with specific reference to decades of stagnation. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's Iceland example and AAUW study, but responses are defensive rather than offensive. Admits NBER study focuses on different mechanism, weakening own argument. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Compares economic stimulation from increased purchasing power against speculative job losses. Emphasizes magnitude of persistent discrimination and timeframe of decades of failed voluntary approaches. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions potential job losses but doesn't quantify or compare magnitude. Calls PRO's economic benefits \"speculative\" but doesn't weigh competing impacts clearly. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO consistently maintains burden of proof that mandates are necessary AND effective\n- CON's strongest argument (unintended consequences) is undermined by their own admission that cited evidence doesn't directly apply\n- PRO's Iceland example stands largely unrefuted beyond \"not replicable\" without explanation\n- The \"personal choices\" argument from CON doesn't engage with PRO's \"controlling for factors\" claim\n- PRO's weighing of \"decades of stagnation\" vs. speculative harms is more concrete\n\nScores remain stable across both passes.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins on superior evidence grounding (specific studies and examples), stronger clash (directly refuting key CON arguments), and clearer impact weighing (concrete timeframe and magnitude comparisons). CON's reliance on speculative harms and admission that their cited evidence applies to a different mechanism significantly weakens their position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence integration, including specific AAUW study and Iceland example, while effectively refuting CON's job loss concerns by noting cited evidence applies to different mechanisms.
