  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear thesis about nationalism fostering \"us vs them\" mentality. Arguments are coherent and well-structured around erosion of cooperation, social tensions, and xenophobia. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers clear counter-framework about responsible nationalism. Arguments about identity, democratic engagement, and coexistence with cooperation are logically structured. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References historical examples (WWI, WWII), contemporary cases (America First, Brexit), and specific outcomes (hate crimes). Provides concrete mechanisms. Score: 4\n- CON: Uses Canada as example of multiculturalism within nationalism, references civic engagement patterns, but evidence is more general and less specific than PRO's. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's unity argument, challenges the crisis example, refutes democratic governance claim, and attacks the coexistence thesis with climate change example. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Addresses the \"us vs them\" claim with Canada example, responds to democratic governance criticism, and counters global cooperation concern. Good engagement but less direct dismantling of PRO's core examples. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs negative consequences against benefits, argues exceptions vs. rule, compares magnitude of harm (marginalization, global cooperation erosion) against claimed benefits. Clear comparative framework. Score: 4\n- CON: Claims constructive aspects outweigh negatives but provides less explicit comparison of magnitude, probability, or scope. More assertion than comparative weighing. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing for consistency:\n- PRO maintains stronger evidentiary grounding throughout with specific historical and contemporary examples\n- CON's Canada example is somewhat undercut by PRO's point about exceptions vs. rule\n- PRO's climate change example as evidence of nationalism undermining cooperation is concrete and unrefuted\n- CON's argument about responsible nationalism is theoretically sound but less grounded in specific evidence\n- PRO provides clearer impact calculus in summary\n\n## Third Pass - Final Check\n\nKey deciding factors:\n1. PRO provided more concrete historical/contemporary evidence\n2. PRO more effectively engaged and refuted CON's central claims\n3. PRO offered clearer comparative weighing of impacts\n4. CON's \"responsible nationalism\" framework, while coherent, remained more theoretical\n5. PRO's examples (Brexit hate crimes, climate inaction) were not effectively countered\n\nWinner: PRO\nConfidence: 0.72 (Clear but contestable - CON presented coherent arguments but weaker evidence and weighing)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through stronger evidence and impact weighing. While both sides presented coherent arguments, PRO provided more concrete historical examples (WWI/WWII, Brexit, climate inaction) and clearer comparative analysis of harms versus benefits. CON's responsible nationalism framework remained largely theoretical, with the Canada example insufficient to counter PRO's systematic evidence of nationalist movements causing marginalization and undermining cooperation.\"\n}\n```",
