  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through multiple passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured arguments about addiction (2M pathological, 4-6M problem gamblers), financial ruin, and regressive taxation. Arguments are logically connected and internally consistent. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers coherent counter-arguments about personal freedom, economic benefits ($41B tax revenue), and responsible regulation. However, some tension between acknowledging harm and dismissing it. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites National Council on Problem Gambling statistics, provides specific numbers for addiction rates and social costs (tens of billions). References UK regulation as evidence that regulation fails. Score: 4\n- CON: Cites American Gaming Association ($41B revenue figure), references UK as successful regulation example. Less specific on addiction statistics or cost-benefit analysis. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's personal choice argument (addiction compromises choice), challenges economic benefit claim with cost comparison, refutes regulation alternative with UK example. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to addiction concerns but doesn't address PRO's specific cost figures or the net loss argument. Repeats points rather than engaging with PRO's cost-benefit analysis. Score: 2\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly compares $41B revenue to \"tens of billions\" in social costs, frames as net loss. Weighs human suffering against economic benefits, prioritizes protection of vulnerable populations. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions economic benefits and personal freedom but doesn't comparatively weigh against PRO's harm claims or address the net cost argument. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- PRO establishes harm framework early and maintains it throughout\n- CON's UK example is turned against them by PRO (showing regulation doesn't solve)\n- PRO's cost-benefit analysis ($41B vs tens of billions in costs) is never directly refuted by CON\n- CON repeats \"responsible regulation\" without addressing why it would work when PRO claims it fails\n- The \"personal choice\" argument is weakened by PRO's addiction statistics showing compromised choice\n\n## Third Pass - Stability Check\n\nKey decision points:\n1. Did CON adequately respond to the net cost argument? No - they repeated the $41B figure without addressing PRO's larger cost claim\n2. Did CON successfully defend regulation as viable? Weak - didn't counter PRO's UK example effectively\n3. Did PRO prove ban is necessary vs. better regulation? Yes - showed regulation fails, costs exceed benefits\n4. Was the personal freedom argument sufficient? No - PRO's addiction statistics undermine voluntary choice claim\n\nThe winner remains consistent across passes: PRO wins on superior clash, comparative weighing, and unanswered cost-benefit analysis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior comparative weighing and clash.
