  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically through multiple passes to ensure consistency.\n\n## First Pass Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure, coherent claims about convenience, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. Framework established early. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-organized arguments about diagnostic accuracy, personal connection, and health disparities. Logical flow maintained. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites American Telemedicine Association (75% satisfaction), National Institute of Health (30% cost reduction), Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare. Score: 4\n- CON: References Journal of the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association survey. Specific conditions mentioned (hypertension, diabetes, skin disorders). Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses physical examination concerns by distinguishing routine vs. complex visits. Responds to digital divide with solution-oriented approach. Counters personal connection argument with evidence. Score: 4\n- CON: Reiterates original points but doesn't fully engage with PRO's distinction between routine and complex visits. Maintains position on digital divide without addressing PRO's proposed solutions. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs accessibility, cost reduction (30%), and patient satisfaction against concerns. Frames telemedicine as supplementary, not complete replacement. Score: 4\n- CON: Emphasizes diagnostic accuracy and equity but less comparative weighing of impacts. Focuses on why their concerns matter but doesn't directly compare magnitude against PRO's benefits. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's key strategic advantage: They reframe the resolution as \"supplement and enhance\" rather than complete elimination, making their position more defensible. They provide specific percentages and address each CON argument directly.\n\nCON's limitation: While they maintain strong principled arguments, they don't effectively counter PRO's distinction that \"most routine visits\" (follow-ups, medication management) don't require physical examination. They also don't engage with PRO's evidence about patient satisfaction in telemedicine.\n\nThe critical dropped argument: CON never adequately responds to PRO's claim that many routine visits don't require comprehensive physical assessments, which is central to the resolution.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins on superior clash and weighing. They engaged more directly with opponent arguments and provided clearer comparative analysis of impacts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior clash and weighing. They effectively distinguished routine visits from complex cases, directly refuted CON's concerns with evidence, and provided comparative impact analysis. CON maintained strong principled arguments but failed to engage with PRO's central distinction about which visits require physical examination, leaving a critical argument largely uncontested.\"\n}\n```",
