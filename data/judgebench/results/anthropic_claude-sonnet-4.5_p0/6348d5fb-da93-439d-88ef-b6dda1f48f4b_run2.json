  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured arguments (youth responsibilities, civic engagement, information access, equality principle). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers well-structured counterarguments focusing on maturity, civic education gaps, and electoral integrity. Arguments are logical and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Austria and Scotland as examples, references studies on habit formation and youth engagement, but lacks specific data. Some assertions about cognitive development and youth information levels need more support. Score: 3\n- CON: Points to civic education differences between countries, discusses cognitive maturity concerns with reasoning, but also relies heavily on assertions about maturity without concrete evidence. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's maturity argument, engages with civic education concern by proposing simultaneous implementation, responds to misinformation point by noting it affects all ages. Score: 4\n- CON: Effectively challenges PRO's maturity claims, distinguishes between life decisions and voting complexity, directly refutes the \"cart before horse\" logic of voting before education. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes democratic inclusion, long-term civic engagement, and representation of youth interests. Provides comparative framework (youth already have responsibilities). Score: 3\n- CON: Focuses on electoral integrity risks, misinformation susceptibility, and need for proper preparation. Weighs potential harms against benefits but less explicit comparative weighing. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- Both sides maintain consistent argumentation\n- CON's \"cart before horse\" argument about civic education is particularly strong and largely unrefuted by PRO\n- PRO's equality/consistency argument (responsibilities without representation) is compelling but CON distinguishes voting from other responsibilities\n- The civic education point becomes central: PRO suggests doing both simultaneously, CON argues education must come first\n- CON more effectively questions the foundational premise (are 16-year-olds ready?) while PRO assumes readiness\n\nThe debate is very close. CON's argument that voting requires different maturity than other teen responsibilities, combined with the civic education sequencing argument, slightly edges out PRO's inclusion-based case.\n\n## Final Consistency Check\n\nWinner: CON by a narrow margin\n- CON more effectively challenged PRO's core assumption about readiness\n- The civic education sequencing argument (\"cart before horse\") was not adequately answered\n- Both sides performed similarly on clash and structure\n- CON's risk-based framework (electoral integrity) slightly outweighs PRO's benefit-based framework (inclusion)\n\nConfidence: 0.55 (very close debate, could reasonably go either way)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.55,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins narrowly by effectively distinguishing voting from other teen responsibilities and establishing that civic education must precede voting rights. PRO's proposal to implement both simultaneously was insufficiently developed against CON's sequencing argument. CON's focus on electoral integrity risks slightly outweighed PRO's inclusion benefits in a very close debate.\"\n}\n```",
