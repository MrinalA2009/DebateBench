  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (common heritage, conflict prevention, scientific advancement). Arguments are coherent and well-structured. Score: 4\n- CON: Also presents three clear contentions (investment incentives, resource security, human expansion). Equally coherent structure. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References Outer Space Treaty of 1967, International Space Station as example, historical patterns of territorial disputes. Provides concrete grounding. Score: 4\n- CON: References current stagnation under Outer Space Treaty, capital-intensive nature of space exploration, finite Earth resources. Also well-grounded. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's investment argument, addresses resource security claim, responds to expansion argument with ISS counterexample. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Effectively responds to monopolization concerns, addresses conflict argument with legal framework solution, distinguishes ISS from self-sustaining economic model. Very direct refutation. Score: 5\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Weighs inequality, conflict risk, and collaborative benefits. Mentions climate change and poverty as comparative priorities. Some weighing present. Score: 3\n- CON: Weighs stagnation vs. progress, resource depletion urgency, multi-planetary survival. Explicitly frames choice between \"stagnation\" and \"innovation.\" Clearer comparative weighing. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing clash specifically: CON's rebuttal more directly dismantles PRO's framework by arguing the Outer Space Treaty has \"demonstrably failed\" and that legal frameworks can prevent conflict while enabling ownership. CON also makes a critical distinction between government-funded collaboration (ISS) and self-sustaining economic models.\n\nPRO's responses are solid but somewhat defensive - they reassert their position without fully addressing CON's core claim that the current system has led to stagnation.\n\nImpact weighing: CON frames the debate as a binary choice (stagnation vs. progress) and emphasizes urgency of resource depletion and human survival. PRO mentions important issues but doesn't clearly explain why preventing ownership outweighs the development benefits CON identifies.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nCON edges ahead primarily on clash and weighing. CON more effectively undermines PRO's framework by pointing to the Outer Space Treaty's limited results, while PRO doesn't adequately respond to the stagnation argument. CON's distinction between collaborative scientific missions and self-sustaining economic expansion is a key point that PRO doesn't fully address.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 5\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior clash and weighing.
