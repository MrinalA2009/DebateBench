  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear framework (restorative justice), logical progression, coherent claims about victim involvement benefits. Score: 4\n- CON: Clear counter-framework emphasizing objectivity/fairness, logical concerns about bias and inconsistency. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References \"studies\" showing victim satisfaction and closure, mentions empirical evidence and existing victim impact statements, but lacks specific citations. Score: 3\n- CON: Relies more on logical reasoning about systemic concerns than empirical evidence, but grounds arguments in legal principles. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's consistency concerns, refutes \"innocent until proven guilty\" argument by noting sentencing occurs post-conviction, engages with objectivity concerns. Score: 4\n- CON: Directly challenges PRO's structured programs claim, rebuts the \"innocent until proven guilty\" response, engages with restorative justice claims. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Weighs victim healing/satisfaction against system concerns, argues benefits outweigh drawbacks, compares rehabilitation outcomes. Score: 4\n- CON: Weighs systemic integrity against individual satisfaction, emphasizes broader societal goals over individual grievances, prioritizes fairness. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass (Consistency Check)\n\nRe-examining key clash points:\n\n1. **Consistency/Bias concern**: CON argues victim input creates inconsistency; PRO responds with \"structured programs\" but doesn't fully resolve how emotional input won't vary outcomes. CON effectively rebuts that judges remain human and susceptible to emotional influence.\n\n2. **\"Innocent until proven guilty\"**: PRO makes strong point that sentencing is post-conviction. CON's rebuttal that this still \"operates within framework of fairness\" is weaker - doesn't directly address PRO's temporal distinction.\n\n3. **Restorative justice benefits**: PRO claims reduced recidivism and victim satisfaction. CON concedes these may exist but argues they don't justify compromising system integrity. This is comparative weighing, but CON doesn't prove the compromise is inevitable.\n\n4. **Systemic goals**: CON emphasizes deterrence/rehabilitation over individual satisfaction. PRO argues victim input enhances rehabilitation. Neither fully proves their mechanism.\n\nAdjusting scores:\n- PRO's rebuttal on \"innocent until proven guilty\" was stronger than initially credited\n- CON's consistency argument remains unresolved by PRO's \"structured programs\" response\n- Both sides engage well but neither delivers knockout blows\n\n## Third Pass (Final Verification)\n\nCritical decision points:\n- PRO establishes that victim input occurs post-conviction (strong procedural point)\n- CON's core concern about emotional bias affecting consistency remains partially unaddressed\n- PRO provides mechanism (restorative justice) with claimed empirical support\n- CON provides principled objection but less concrete evidence of harm\n\nThe debate is very close. PRO slightly edges ahead because:\n1. Successfully refutes the \"innocent until proven guilty\" concern\n2. Provides affirmative mechanism (restorative justice) with claimed benefits\n3. CON's main argument relies on potential for bias but doesn't prove structured programs can't mitigate this\n\nHowever, CON maintains strong ground on systemic integrity concerns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.55,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins narrowly by successfully refuting CON's 'innocent until proven guilty' objection with the temporal distinction that sentencing occurs post-conviction, and by providing an affirmative mechanism (restorative justice) with claimed empirical benefits. CON's consistency concerns remain valid but unproven to be insurmountable through structured programs. The debate was extremely close with strong clash on both sides.\"\n}\n```",
