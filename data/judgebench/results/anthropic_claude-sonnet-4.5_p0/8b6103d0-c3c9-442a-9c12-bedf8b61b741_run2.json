  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear thesis about systemic issues in policing and need for reallocation. Arguments are coherent and well-structured around CAHOOTS example. Score: 4\n- CON: Clear counter-arguments about public safety necessity and Minneapolis example. Advocates for reform over defunding. Well-organized but slightly repetitive. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites CAHOOTS program in Eugene with specific claims about outcomes. References studies on police budget allocation and crisis response. Score: 4\n- CON: Uses Minneapolis 2020 example with specific claim about crime surge. Less detailed evidence overall, more general assertions about police necessity. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses Minneapolis example, challenges CON's characterization of social services limitations, engages with the \"balanced approach\" argument. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to CAHOOTS by noting it doesn't eliminate police, addresses escalation claims, challenges root causes argument. Good engagement but less direct on some points. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Frames debate around community safety vs. equity, addresses \"zero-sum\" framing, weighs systemic racism and inefficiency against crime concerns. Moderate weighing. Score: 3\n- CON: Emphasizes public safety risks, crime deterrence, and danger of inadequate response. Less comparative weighing of competing values. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's key advantage: More specific evidence (CAHOOTS), better contextualization of Minneapolis example, stronger direct refutation of CON's claims about social services being inadequate.\n\nCON's key advantage: Maintains consistent public safety framework, but evidence is less developed and responses are more defensive.\n\nThe critical exchange is over Minneapolis - PRO effectively challenges this by noting lack of comprehensive reallocation plan, while CON doesn't adequately defend this example or provide additional evidence.\n\nPRO also successfully argues that not all crises require police, which CON concedes partially by acknowledging integration models work.\n\nScores remain stable on second pass.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins on stronger evidence integration, more effective clash on key examples, and better contextualization of the debate. While both sides present coherent arguments, PRO's specific evidence and direct refutation of CON's main example (Minneapolis) gives them the edge. The debate is relatively close but PRO has a clear advantage in evidence quality and clash.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through stronger evidence integration (CAHOOTS program with specific outcomes) and more effective refutation of CON's key Minneapolis example by contextualizing the lack of comprehensive reallocation.
