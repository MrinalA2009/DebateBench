  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents a clear thesis with logical structure. Arguments are coherent about shifting from criminalization to health approach. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-structured arguments with clear contentions about public safety and infrastructure requirements. Effectively distinguishes Portugal from other contexts. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Portuguese model with specific outcomes (overdose deaths, HIV infections). However, lacks detailed mechanisms or comparative data. Score: 3\n- CON: Provides concrete counter-example (Oregon Measure 110) with specific outcomes. Makes substantive distinction about Portugal's infrastructure requirements. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Engages with CON's arguments but dismisses Oregon example without adequate explanation. Accuses CON of straw man without fully addressing infrastructure concerns. Score: 3\n- CON: Directly addresses PRO's Portugal example, highlights the infrastructure distinction repeatedly, and provides specific counter-evidence. Effectively challenges PRO's dismissal of Oregon. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Mentions reduced overdose deaths and improved public health but doesn't comparatively weigh against CON's safety concerns. Score: 3\n- CON: Explicitly weighs public safety risks, healthcare system capacity, and societal costs against benefits. More comparative analysis. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- CON consistently hammered the infrastructure requirement distinction\n- PRO never provided a plan for replicating Portugal's infrastructure\n- Oregon Measure 110 is a direct counter-example that PRO inadequately addressed\n- CON's \"balanced approach\" framing vs PRO's \"blanket decriminalization\" creates strategic advantage\n- PRO's dismissal of concerns as \"misconceptions\" without substantive refutation weakens their position\n\nThe key turning point: PRO failed to address how decriminalization would work without Portugal's infrastructure, and inadequately responded to the Oregon evidence.\n\n## Final Judgment\n\nCON wins through superior evidence engagement and more effective clash. The Portugal vs. Oregon comparison favored CON because they explained why context matters while PRO treated Portugal as universally applicable. CON's repeated emphasis on infrastructure requirements went largely unaddressed by PRO.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior evidence engagement and clash.
