  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through multiple passes.\n\n## First Pass Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (conflict, exploitation, shared heritage). Arguments are logically structured and internally consistent. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents three counter-contentions (innovation, cooperation, stewardship) but the rebuttal appears to argue against their own position, creating confusion. The CON rebuttal actually supports PRO's arguments. Score: 2\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Uses historical examples (scramble for Africa, resource wars), references Outer Space Treaty, provides mechanisms (helium-3 example). Well-integrated support. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions SpaceX/Blue Origin and Antarctic research as examples, but provides less detailed grounding. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's innovation, cooperation, and stewardship claims with specific counterarguments. Score: 4\n- CON: The rebuttal is problematic - it appears to argue PRO's position rather than defending CON's stance. This is a critical error. Score: 1\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly articulates impacts (conflict, inequality, environmental degradation) and explains magnitude and irreversibility. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions potential benefits but doesn't effectively weigh them against PRO's impacts. The confused rebuttal undermines weighing. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the CON rebuttal: \"My opponent's arguments hinge on the assumption that regulated ownership will inherently lead to innovation and cooperation. However, this perspective overlooks the historical context...\"\n\nThis is clearly CON arguing against their own constructive position. This is a fundamental structural error that severely undermines CON's case.\n\nPRO maintains consistency throughout, building on their framework and effectively refuting CON's points.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Confirmation\n\nThe critical issue is CON's rebuttal error. Combined with PRO's superior clash, evidence integration, and impact weighing, PRO wins decisively.\n\nScores confirmed:\n- Argument Quality: PRO 4, CON 2\n- Evidence: PRO 4, CON 3  \n- Clash: PRO 4, CON 1\n- Weighing: PRO 4, CON 2\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 1\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively.
