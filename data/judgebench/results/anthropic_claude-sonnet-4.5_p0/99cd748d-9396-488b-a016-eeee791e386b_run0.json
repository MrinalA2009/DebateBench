  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents a clear three-part structure (technology, philosophy, statistics). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Challenges each PRO argument but relies heavily on asserting complexity without developing counter-mechanisms. Arguments are somewhat reactive. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Bostrom's trilemma specifically, references Meta and gaming companies, provides philosophical framework. Score: 4\n- CON: Challenges PRO's evidence but offers limited alternative evidence or examples. Relies on assertions about \"complexity\" and \"richness of experience\" without grounding. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's critiques about linear progress, false dichotomy, and statistical flaws. Engages point-by-point. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's arguments but often restates objections without developing new responses. Some engagement but repetitive. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs probability through statistical argument, discusses magnitude through \"countless civilizations,\" provides comparative framework. Score: 4\n- CON: Focuses on skepticism and \"need for concrete evidence\" but doesn't comparatively weigh why their position matters more or what impacts favor their side. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing for consistency:\n- PRO maintains structural advantage throughout, building cumulative case\n- CON's strongest point (complexity of consciousness) is asserted but not developed with mechanisms\n- PRO's statistical argument goes largely unrefuted beyond \"unproven assumptions\"\n- CON drops the trilemma's force by calling it a \"false dichotomy\" without explaining what options are missing\n- Weighing clearly favors PRO who explains why probability matters; CON only demands evidence without weighing impacts\n\n## Third Pass - Final Check\n\nWinner determination: PRO wins on superior evidence integration, clearer weighing, and more effective clash. CON's skepticism is reasonable but doesn't outweigh PRO's probabilistic framework.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 - Clear winner but CON raised legitimate epistemological concerns that weren't fully resolved.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence integration (Bostrom's trilemma, technological trajectory) and clearer impact weighing via statistical probability arguments. CON's skepticism about complexity and empirical proof was asserted but underdeveloped, failing to comparatively weigh why demanding concrete evidence outweighs PRO's probabilistic framework. PRO effectively refuted key objections while CON largely restated concerns without advancing new mechanisms.\"\n}\n```",
