  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with two contentions (criminal impunity, equality before law). Logical progression and coherent framework. Score: 4\n- CON: Structured defense of status quo, but relies heavily on theoretical mechanisms without addressing their practical failures. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific BBC report (5,000+ crimes in UK over 5 years with virtually no prosecutions). Concrete, relevant evidence. Score: 4\n- CON: Makes claims about sending state prosecution and expulsion but provides no evidence these mechanisms work in practice. Largely theoretical assertions. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's claims about sending state prosecution and expulsion, showing they're ineffective in practice. Addresses the \"breakdown in relations\" argument by reframing it. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's evidence but dismisses it as \"rare\" without counter-evidence. Claims complexity of distinguishing official/non-official acts but doesn't prove this is insurmountable. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Weighs justice for victims and trust in international relations against theoretical diplomatic concerns. Explains why accountability strengthens rather than weakens cooperation. Score: 4\n- CON: Warns of \"dangerous precedent\" and \"breakdown\" but doesn't weigh these against the harms of current system. Minimal comparative analysis. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO's BBC evidence (5,000 crimes, virtually no prosecutions) is never effectively refuted by CON\n- CON's claim that existing mechanisms are \"sufficient\" is directly contradicted by PRO's evidence\n- PRO maintains focus on \"limitation\" not \"abolition\" - a crucial distinction CON doesn't adequately address\n- CON's \"slippery slope\" argument about political exploitation lacks grounding\n- PRO's weighing (trust through accountability vs. theoretical breakdown) is more developed than CON's\n\nScores remain stable across both passes.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins because:\n1. Provided concrete evidence (BBC report) that CON never effectively refuted\n2. Demonstrated practical failure of current mechanisms CON claimed were sufficient\n3. Maintained clear distinction between limitation and abolition\n4. Better comparative weighing of impacts\n\nConfidence: 0.75 (Clear winner, though CON made reasonable structural arguments about diplomatic relations)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence and weighing.
