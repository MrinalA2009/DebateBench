  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured contentions with specific mechanisms (frequent flyer levy, personal carbon allowance). Arguments are internally consistent and logically developed. Score: 4\n- CON: Raises valid concerns about equity and technology, but arguments are somewhat repetitive and less precisely structured. The claim about regressive impacts contradicts their own acknowledgment of targeting high-frequency flyers. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific sources (ICAO projections, Global Environmental Change 2020 study with the 1% statistic), provides concrete data (2.5% of global CO2, potential doubling/tripling by 2050). Score: 5\n- CON: Makes general claims about aviation industry investments and sustainable fuels but provides no specific sources, studies, or data. The \"up to 80%\" reduction claim is unsupported. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's equity concerns by explaining the progressive nature of their mechanism, refutes the technology argument with timeline concerns, and responds to the modal shift argument. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's arguments but often restates positions rather than directly refuting PRO's evidence. Doesn't effectively counter the 1% statistic or the timeline problem with technology. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly weighs climate catastrophe against inconvenience, emphasizes urgency and immediacy of action needed, compares their solution to inadequate alternatives. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions unintended consequences and social equity but doesn't comparatively weigh these against climate impacts or explain why they outweigh PRO's concerns. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO's 1% statistic creating 50% of emissions is never effectively challenged by CON\n- CON's technology argument is undermined by lack of specific evidence and PRO's timeline concerns\n- PRO's progressive framing (targeting high-frequency flyers) is more defensible than CON's regressive claim\n- CON's equity concerns are somewhat speculative without evidence that essential travelers would be affected\n- PRO maintains consistent focus on urgency and immediate action vs. future promises\n\nScores remain stable across both passes.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins on superior evidence, clearer impact weighing, and more effective clash. The 1% statistic is a critical piece of evidence that CON never adequately addresses, and it supports PRO's equity framing. CON's reliance on unsubstantiated claims about future technology and speculative harms weakens their position.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 (Clear winner, though CON raised legitimate concerns about implementation)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding, particularly the unchallenged 1% statistic demonstrating progressive impact.
