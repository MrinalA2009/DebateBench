  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents a clear position that diplomatic immunity should be limited, distinguishes between official and personal acts, maintains coherent structure throughout. Score: 4\n- CON: Articulates clear contentions about diplomatic function, retaliation risks, and existing mechanisms. Well-structured arguments about Vienna Convention's role. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References \"numerous cases\" of abuse but provides no specific examples. Claims about mechanisms being \"often ineffective\" lack support. Assertions about \"most diplomats\" operating within local laws unsupported. Score: 2\n- CON: Cites Vienna Convention as concrete legal framework, explains specific mechanisms (waivers, persona non grata), provides logical reasoning about reciprocity in international relations. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's Vienna Convention argument, addresses retaliation concerns, responds to harassment claims. However, doesn't adequately address the \"who decides\" challenge about official vs. personal acts. Score: 3\n- CON: Directly challenges PRO's official/personal distinction with specific question (\"Who decides?\"), refutes the \"different era\" claim, addresses the retaliation dismissal. Strong engagement throughout. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Claims impacts of accountability \"far outweigh\" risks but doesn't explain magnitude, probability, or timeframe comparatively. Asserts trust-building benefits without comparative analysis. Score: 2\n- CON: Explicitly weighs \"speculative promise of accountability\" against \"very real and immediate threat\" of destabilized relations. Discusses magnitude (global cooperation) and probability (inevitable retaliation). Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing for consistency:\n- PRO's main weakness is lack of concrete evidence and inadequate response to the subjective interpretation problem\n- CON effectively identifies the critical flaw in PRO's proposal (who decides official vs. personal)\n- CON provides superior grounding through Vienna Convention and existing mechanisms\n- CON's weighing is comparative while PRO's is largely assertive\n\n## Final Determination\n\nCON wins on superior evidence/grounding (4 vs 2), clash (4 vs 3), and weighing (4 vs 2). While argument quality is tied, CON's ability to identify and exploit the fatal flaw in PRO's official/personal distinction, combined with concrete legal framework references and comparative impact analysis, provides the decisive advantage.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior evidence grounding (Vienna Convention, existing mechanisms), effective identification of PRO's critical flaw (subjective official/personal distinction), and comparative impact weighing (immediate destabilization vs. speculative accountability gains). PRO failed to provide concrete examples of abuse or adequately address the 'who decides' challenge, while relying primarily on assertions rather than supported claims.\"\n}\n```",
