  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents a clear position that diplomatic immunity should be limited, distinguishes between official and personal acts, argues for accountability. Arguments are coherent but somewhat repetitive across speeches. Score: 3\n- CON: Articulates clear contentions about diplomatic function, retaliation risks, and existing mechanisms. Effectively challenges PRO's distinction between official/personal acts as subjective and unworkable. More structured and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References \"numerous cases\" of abuse but provides no specific examples. Claims about existing mechanisms and diplomat behavior are asserted without support. Score: 2\n- CON: Cites the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as foundational international law, references specific mechanisms (waivers, persona non grata), provides concrete reasoning about reciprocity in international relations. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Engages CON's Vienna Convention argument by calling it \"outdated,\" addresses retaliation concerns as \"unfounded,\" but doesn't substantively respond to the subjective interpretation problem CON raises. Score: 3\n- CON: Directly challenges PRO's official/personal distinction as unworkable, questions who would decide what's \"official,\" rebuts the \"different era\" claim about Vienna Convention, addresses the formalization argument. More thorough engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Claims impacts of accountability and trust \"far outweigh\" risks but doesn't explain magnitude, probability, or timeframe comparatively. Asserts rather than weighs. Score: 2\n- CON: Explicitly weighs \"speculative promise of accountability\" against \"very real and immediate threat\" of destabilized relations, discusses consequences of retaliation cycle, explains why disruption matters more. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- CON consistently provides more concrete grounding (Vienna Convention, specific mechanisms)\n- PRO's central distinction (official vs. personal acts) is challenged as subjective but PRO never adequately defends how this would work in practice\n- CON's retaliation argument (based on reciprocity) is dismissed by PRO as \"unfounded\" without counter-evidence\n- CON's weighing in final speech directly compares impacts while PRO simply asserts theirs are greater\n\nThe scores remain stable across both passes.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nCON wins on superior evidence grounding, more effective clash (particularly on the official/personal distinction), and clearer comparative weighing. PRO's case relies heavily on assertions about abuse without examples and fails to adequately defend their core mechanism against CON's substantive challenges.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior evidence grounding (Vienna Convention, specific mechanisms), effective refutation of PRO's official/personal distinction as unworkable and subjective, and clearer comparative weighing of immediate destabilization risks versus speculative accountability benefits.
