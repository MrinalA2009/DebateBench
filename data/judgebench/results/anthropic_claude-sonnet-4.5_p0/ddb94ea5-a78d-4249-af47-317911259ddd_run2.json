  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through multiple passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents a clear thesis with logical structure. Arguments flow coherently from problem identification to solution. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-structured counterarguments with clear contentions. Distinguishes between decriminalization models effectively. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Portuguese model with specific outcomes (overdose deaths, HIV infections). Limited detail on mechanisms. Score: 3\n- CON: References both Portugal AND Oregon's Measure 110 with specific outcomes. Provides comparative analysis of different implementations. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Addresses CON's Portugal critique but doesn't engage Oregon evidence substantively. Dismisses it as \"misleading\" without detailed refutation. Score: 3\n- CON: Directly engages PRO's Portugal argument, distinguishes infrastructure requirements, and provides counter-evidence (Oregon). Systematically addresses PRO's rebuttals. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Mentions benefits (reduced deaths, improved outcomes) but limited comparative weighing against CON's concerns. Score: 3\n- CON: Explicitly weighs public safety risks, healthcare system capacity, and crime increases. Compares costs vs. benefits more directly. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. **Portugal model**: CON successfully distinguishes infrastructure requirements; PRO doesn't adequately respond to this nuance\n2. **Oregon evidence**: CON introduces this as direct counter-evidence; PRO dismisses without substantive engagement\n3. **Implementation plan**: CON repeatedly challenges lack of replication plan; PRO never provides one\n4. **Public safety**: CON provides mechanism (emboldened traffickers \u2192 availability \u2192 crime); PRO calls it \"oversimplification\" but doesn't refute the causal chain\n\nCON maintains stronger evidential grounding and more effective clash throughout.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking for dropped arguments:\n- CON's infrastructure replication challenge: Never adequately addressed by PRO\n- CON's Oregon evidence: Dismissed but not refuted by PRO\n- PRO's harm reduction programs: Not directly challenged by CON but contextualized within infrastructure concerns\n\nWinner determination: CON wins on superior evidence (two case studies vs. one), more effective clash (directly engaging and refuting PRO's key example), and clearer impact weighing (public safety costs vs. health benefits).\n\nConfidence: 0.75 - Clear winner but PRO had coherent arguments; the debate turned on evidential engagement rather than fundamental logical flaws.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior evidence deployment (Portugal AND Oregon vs. Portugal alone), more effective clash (directly refuting infrastructure requirements PRO never addressed), and clearer impact weighing of public safety costs. PRO's failure to engage Oregon evidence or provide implementation plan proved decisive.\"\n}\n```",
