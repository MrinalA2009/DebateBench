  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured contentions with logical flow. Arguments are coherent and well-organized around public safety framework. (4/5)\n- CON: Offers coherent constitutional arguments but relies heavily on abstract principles. Arguments about \"root causes\" are less developed. (3/5)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Provides specific data (Australia's 59% and 65% reductions), cites CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics, references Heller case. Strong empirical support. (5/5)\n- CON: Makes constitutional claims but provides no specific data, studies, or examples. Arguments about \"driving underground\" and cultural differences are asserted without evidence. (2/5)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's Second Amendment argument with Heller precedent, refutes cultural differences claim as \"red herring,\" challenges underground market speculation. (4/5)\n- CON: Engages with PRO's Australia example and regulation mechanisms, but responses are largely defensive assertions rather than substantive refutations. (3/5)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly prioritizes public safety over unrestricted gun rights, uses magnitude (lives saved) and probability (proven effectiveness). Establishes framework early. (4/5)\n- CON: Attempts to balance rights and safety but doesn't comparatively weigh why individual rights should outweigh demonstrated mortality reduction. (2/5)\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO's Australia evidence remains unrefuted with counter-data\n- CON's \"cultural differences\" argument is asserted but never explained mechanistically\n- PRO's Heller citation directly answers CON's constitutional absolutism\n- CON's \"root causes\" alternative is mentioned but not developed with evidence\n- PRO maintains consistent framework throughout; CON's framework is less clear\n\nScores remain stable.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins through superior evidence and weighing. While CON raises legitimate constitutional concerns, they fail to provide empirical support or explain why their framework should override PRO's demonstrated life-saving impacts. PRO's Australia data and CDC citations go largely uncontested with counter-evidence, and PRO effectively neutralizes the Second Amendment objection with Heller precedent.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively through superior evidence and impact weighing.
