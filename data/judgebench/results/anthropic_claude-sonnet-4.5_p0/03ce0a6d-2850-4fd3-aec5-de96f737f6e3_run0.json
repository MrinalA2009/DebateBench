  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (conflict, exploitation, shared heritage). Arguments are logically structured and internally consistent. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents three counter-contentions (innovation, cooperation, stewardship) but the rebuttal section appears to argue against their own position, creating significant confusion and contradiction. Score: 2\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Uses historical examples (scramble for Africa, resource wars), references Outer Space Treaty, provides mechanisms (helium-3 example, profit motives). Score: 4\n- CON: References SpaceX/Blue Origin, Outer Space Treaty, Antarctic research model, but provides less detailed mechanisms. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's three main arguments, provides specific counterarguments about inequality, historical precedent, and profit motives. Score: 4\n- CON: The rebuttal section is problematic - it appears to argue PRO's position rather than defending CON's case, creating minimal effective clash. Score: 2\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly articulates impacts (conflict, inequality, environmental degradation) and compares magnitude. Emphasizes irreversibility and catastrophic outcomes. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions benefits but doesn't effectively weigh them against PRO's impacts or explain why they outweigh risks. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nRe-examining the CON rebuttal: \"My opponent's arguments hinge on the assumption that regulated ownership will inherently lead to innovation and cooperation. However, this perspective overlooks the historical context...\" \n\nThis is clearly CON arguing against their own constructive position. This is a critical error that undermines their entire case.\n\nPRO maintains consistency throughout, building on their framework and directly refuting CON's points.\n\n**Scores remain:**\n- Argument Quality: PRO 4, CON 2\n- Evidence: PRO 4, CON 3\n- Clash: PRO 4, CON 2\n- Weighing: PRO 4, CON 2\n\n**Winner: PRO** - Clear victory due to CON's self-contradictory rebuttal and PRO's superior engagement and impact comparison.\n\n**Confidence: 0.95** - Very clear winner due to CON's critical structural error.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively.
