  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear thesis about systemic issues in policing and need for reallocation. Arguments are coherent and logically structured around root causes of crime. Score: 4\n- CON: Clear counter-arguments about public safety necessity and balanced approach. Well-structured but somewhat defensive positioning. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites CAHOOTS program in Eugene, Oregon with specific mechanisms (unarmed medics, crisis workers). References studies on police budget allocation and mental health crisis escalation. Score: 4\n- CON: Cites Minneapolis 2020 crime surge example. However, acknowledges in rebuttal that crime has \"complex socio-economic factors,\" which somewhat undermines their own evidence. Less specific mechanisms provided. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses Minneapolis example, noting lack of comprehensive reallocation plan. Challenges the \"all crises need police\" claim with mental health crisis examples. Addresses resource limitation argument. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with Eugene example but concedes it maintains some police presence (which actually supports integrated model, not pure defunding opposition). Acknowledges police can escalate situations but doesn't fully refute this point. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Frames debate around \"root causes\" vs. reactive policing. Argues this isn't zero-sum between safety and services. Weighs systemic racism and community trust as key impacts. Score: 4\n- CON: Emphasizes public safety as primary impact but doesn't comparatively weigh against PRO's systemic issues claims. Advocates \"balanced approach\" but doesn't explain why this is superior to reallocation. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. Minneapolis example: PRO effectively contextualizes this by noting lack of comprehensive plan; CON later admits crime has multiple factors, weakening their own evidence\n2. Eugene model: CON concedes it works but maintains some police presence - this actually supports reform, not opposition to reallocation\n3. Crisis response: PRO provides specific mechanism (mental health crises don't need police, police can escalate); CON acknowledges escalation risk but doesn't refute the core claim\n4. Resource allocation: PRO addresses this directly; CON doesn't engage with limited resource reality\n\nPRO maintains more consistent argumentation throughout. CON's concessions (crime complexity, police escalation acknowledgment) weaken their position.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking for dropped arguments:\n- PRO's systemic racism claim: Not directly refuted by CON\n- PRO's root causes framework: CON mentions it but doesn't comparatively weigh against it\n- CON's \"dangerous situations need police\": PRO narrows this to specific crisis types, CON doesn't defend the broader claim\n\nWinner determination: PRO wins on stronger evidence integration, more effective clash, and clearer impact weighing. CON's defensive positioning and self-undermining concessions weaken their case.\n\nConfidence: 0.72 - Clear winner but CON made reasonable arguments about public safety that weren't completely dismantled.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through stronger evidence integration (CAHOOTS program with specific mechanisms), more effective refutation (contextualizing Minneapolis, addressing crisis response), and clearer impact weighing around root causes versus reactive policing.
