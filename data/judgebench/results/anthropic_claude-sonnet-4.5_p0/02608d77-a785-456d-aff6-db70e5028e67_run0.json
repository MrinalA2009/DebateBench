  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with two contentions (criminal behavior without consequence, equality before law). Arguments are coherent and well-developed. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents counterarguments about sending state jurisdiction and expulsion mechanisms. Arguments are logical but somewhat defensive. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific BBC report (5,000 crimes in UK over 5 years with virtually no prosecutions). Concrete, relevant evidence. Score: 4\n- CON: References Vienna Convention and theoretical mechanisms but lacks concrete counter-evidence to PRO's statistics. More assertion-based. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's jurisdiction/expulsion argument, calling it \"fundamentally flawed\" and explaining why with evidence. Addresses fear-mongering claim. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's evidence but dismisses it as \"extremely rare\" without counter-statistics. Claims complexity of official/non-official distinction but doesn't prove it's unworkable. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Compares justice for victims vs. diplomatic functionality, argues limited immunity strengthens rather than weakens cooperation. Clear comparative framework. Score: 4\n- CON: Warns of \"dangerous precedent\" and \"breakdown in international relations\" but doesn't weigh these against PRO's justice concerns or quantify likelihood. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nRe-examining key clash points:\n1. PRO's 5,000 crimes statistic remains unrefuted by counter-evidence\n2. CON's \"sending state prosecution\" argument is effectively countered by PRO showing it rarely happens in practice\n3. PRO's distinction between official/non-official acts is challenged by CON as \"complex\" but CON doesn't prove it's impossible\n4. CON's slippery slope argument (political exploitation) is theoretical vs. PRO's concrete harms\n\nThe weighing advantage clearly goes to PRO - they compare concrete harms (5,000 unprosecuted crimes) against theoretical risks (potential for exploitation), while CON doesn't effectively weigh why diplomatic stability outweighs victim justice.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking for dropped arguments:\n- CON never provides counter-statistics to the 5,000 crimes claim\n- PRO's equality before law argument is not directly refuted\n- CON's complexity argument about official/non-official acts is asserted but not proven\n\nWinner: PRO wins on superior evidence, more effective clash, and clearer impact weighing.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 (Clear winner but CON made reasonable theoretical arguments)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence (5,000 unprosecuted crimes statistic never refuted), more effective clash (directly dismantling CON's sending-state prosecution argument with evidence), and clearer impact weighing (concrete victim harms vs. theoretical diplomatic risks). CON's arguments about existing mechanisms were undermined by PRO's evidence showing they fail in practice.\"\n}\n```",
