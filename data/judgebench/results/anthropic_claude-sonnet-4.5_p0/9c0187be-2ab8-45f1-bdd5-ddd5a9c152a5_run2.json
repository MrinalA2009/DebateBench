  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through multiple passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents a clear thesis about sovereign rights and cultural preservation. Uses specific examples (Maasai, Venice) to illustrate cultural commodification and social disruption. Arguments are coherent and well-structured. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers counter-arguments about economic benefits and sustainable tourism alternatives. However, some arguments (like discrimination concerns) are less developed. Structure is clear but some points lack depth. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Provides concrete examples (Maasai ceremonies, Venice overtourism) with specific mechanisms of harm (staged authenticity, pricing out residents). Evidence directly supports claims. Score: 4\n- CON: References Japan and Bhutan as counter-examples but provides less detail about how they work. Economic claims are somewhat generic. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's sustainable tourism argument by noting that restrictions enable such practices. Effectively turns CON's examples (Japan/Bhutan) to support their case. Addresses the discrimination concern as a \"red herring.\" Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's examples but doesn't effectively counter the core sovereignty argument. The paternalism concern is raised but not fully developed against PRO's framing. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly prioritizes cultural preservation over economic benefits, arguing economic gains are \"short-term\" with \"significant cultural costs.\" Frames the choice as empowerment vs. erosion. Score: 4\n- CON: Discusses economic benefits and cross-cultural understanding but doesn't comparatively weigh these against PRO's cultural erosion impacts. Limited explicit weighing. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's key strength is the strategic reframing - they argue that the \"right to restrict\" doesn't mean isolation but rather empowers the sustainable practices CON advocates. This is a strong turn that CON never adequately addresses.\n\nCON's strongest point about discrimination/paternalism is undermined by not explaining how this outweighs cultural preservation, and PRO dismisses it effectively as not about targeting individuals.\n\nThe Japan/Bhutan examples actually hurt CON because PRO correctly notes these countries DO use restrictions, supporting the resolution.\n\nScores remain consistent with first pass.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking for any missed elements:\n- PRO consistently maintains focus on sovereignty and the right to implement protections\n- CON's economic argument is present but never weighed against cultural costs\n- PRO's turn of CON's examples is a significant strategic victory\n- CON's discrimination concern lacks development and comparative impact\n\nFinal judgment confirmed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior weighing and effective turns. PRO successfully reframes restrictions as enabling sustainable tourism, turning CON's Japan/Bhutan examples to support their case. PRO clearly weighs cultural preservation against economic benefits, while CON fails to comparatively weigh impacts. PRO's concrete examples of cultural commodification (Maasai, Venice) outweigh CON's underdeveloped discrimination concerns.\"\n}\n```",
