  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate through multiple passes to ensure consistency.\n\n## First Pass Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with three main contentions (effectiveness, specialized response, systemic inequality). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-structured response with three counter-arguments. Presents nuanced position but slightly less developed in constructive. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites National Institute of Justice ($1 saves $4), Treatment Advocacy Center report. Specific, quantified evidence. Score: 4\n- CON: References community policing initiatives and crisis intervention training but lacks specific citations or data. More general assertions. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's points about police training, crisis response, and reform sufficiency. Engages with opponent's framework. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to PRO's claims about over-policing and mental health, but some responses are more defensive than offensive. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Consistently emphasizes cost-benefit ($4 saved per $1), systemic inequality dismantling, and community outcomes. Clear comparative framing. Score: 4\n- CON: Discusses public safety but less explicit weighing of why their impacts outweigh PRO's. Mentions \"balanced approach\" without clear impact comparison. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO maintains consistent messaging about root causes, provides concrete evidence (NIJ study), and directly refutes CON's main points about police training and reform sufficiency. The $4 savings claim is specific and unrebutted.\n\nCON makes valid points about community policing and immediate response needs, but relies more on general assertions. The claim that \"studies have shown targeted policing reduces crime\" lacks specificity compared to PRO's cited evidence. CON's \"balanced approach\" argument doesn't clearly weigh why maintaining police funding is more important than PRO's impacts.\n\nKey dropped argument: CON never directly addresses PRO's specific $4 cost savings claim from the NIJ study.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins on superior evidence grounding and impact weighing. While both sides presented coherent arguments, PRO's specific citations and consistent cost-benefit framing gave them the edge. CON's arguments about police necessity were reasonable but less supported by concrete evidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding, citing specific NIJ cost-benefit data ($4 saved per $1 spent) that CON never refuted.
