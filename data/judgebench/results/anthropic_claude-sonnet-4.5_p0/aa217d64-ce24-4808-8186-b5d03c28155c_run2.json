  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear framework (restorative justice), logical progression, coherent claims about victim involvement benefits. Score: 4\n- CON: Clear counter-framework emphasizing objectivity/fairness, logical concerns about bias and inconsistency. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References empirical studies, victim impact statements as existing practice, restorative justice outcomes (recidivism reduction). Score: 4\n- CON: Relies more on logical reasoning about potential harms, less concrete evidence. References to judicial training and legal principles. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses \"innocent until proven guilty\" concern, responds to consistency objection with structured programs argument. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages PRO's structured programs claim, challenges restorative justice justification, addresses the timing argument. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Compares healing/satisfaction vs. punishment, discusses recidivism reduction, weighs benefits vs. drawbacks explicitly in summary. Score: 4\n- CON: Emphasizes systemic integrity over individual satisfaction, weighs fairness principles against victim input benefits. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. **Consistency concern**: CON raises it; PRO responds with structured programs. CON rebuts that emotion still influences judges. This exchange is relatively balanced but PRO provides concrete mechanism (existing programs).\n\n2. **Objectivity**: CON's core argument. PRO counters that sentencing occurs post-guilt, so no presumption violation. CON maintains emotional influence still problematic. CON doesn't fully address the timing distinction PRO makes.\n\n3. **Evidence disparity**: PRO cites studies and existing practices; CON relies more on theoretical concerns without empirical counter-evidence.\n\n4. **Dropped arguments**: CON doesn't effectively counter PRO's claim about existing successful implementations or recidivism data.\n\n## Final Consistency Check\n\nWinner determination factors:\n- PRO provides more concrete grounding (studies, existing practices)\n- PRO addresses CON's main objections with specific mechanisms\n- CON's concerns are logical but less empirically supported\n- PRO's weighing is more explicit and comparative\n- The \"innocent until proven guilty\" rebuttal by PRO (timing argument) is not fully answered by CON\n\nConfidence: 0.70 - Clear winner but CON raised legitimate concerns about bias that weren't fully resolved\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.70,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on superior evidence grounding and weighing. PRO cited empirical studies and existing successful programs while CON relied primarily on theoretical concerns. PRO's timing argument (sentencing occurs post-guilt) effectively countered CON's presumption objection, which CON never fully addressed. PRO also provided clearer comparative weighing between healing benefits and potential drawbacks.\"\n}\n```",
