  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents two clear contentions (wage instability and discrimination/harassment) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-developed. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers multiple points (service incentives, income flexibility, unintended consequences) but some arguments contradict each other or lack full development. The rebuttal appears to concede PRO's points while restating them. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific studies (One Fair Wage 2021, ROC United) with concrete claims (tipped workers twice as likely to experience poverty). Evidence is integrated into arguments. Score: 4\n- CON: References Cornell University study and National Restaurant Association but provides less specific data. Claims about successful no-tipping transitions lack supporting evidence. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's arguments about service incentives and flexibility, reframing them as problems rather than benefits. Addresses job loss concerns with counterexamples. Score: 4\n- CON: The rebuttal is problematic - it appears to agree with PRO's arguments while claiming to oppose them. States \"this system can lead to inconsistent service quality\" and \"unpredictability of tips creates financial instability,\" which are PRO's points. Score: 2\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly weighs poverty rates, harassment reduction, and economic stability against CON's concerns. Explicitly compares \"significant benefits\" to \"exploitative system.\" Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions customer satisfaction and worker preference but doesn't comparatively weigh these against PRO's impacts of poverty and harassment. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the CON rebuttal more carefully: CON's rebuttal actually argues FOR abolishing tipping (\"Workers may prioritize customers who they perceive as generous tippers, neglecting others\" and \"A guaranteed higher wage would provide true financial security\"). This is a critical error that essentially concedes the debate.\n\nPRO maintains consistent advocacy throughout, while CON's rebuttal undermines their own position. This significantly affects clash and argument quality scores.\n\n**Revised scores remain:**\n- Argument Quality: PRO 4, CON 3 (generous given the rebuttal confusion)\n- Evidence: PRO 4, CON 3\n- Clash: PRO 4, CON 2 (CON failed to defend their position in rebuttal)\n- Weighing: PRO 4, CON 2\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins clearly by:\n1. Maintaining consistent advocacy with well-supported arguments\n2. Effectively reframing CON's \"benefits\" as harms\n3. Providing comparative impact analysis (poverty, harassment vs. service quality)\n4. CON's critical error in rebuttal where they argued against their own position\n\nConfidence: 0.85 (Clear winner, though CON had some valid initial points before the rebuttal error)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively through consistent advocacy, superior evidence integration, and effective impact weighing.
