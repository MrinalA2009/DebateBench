  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through multiple passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents a clear thesis about sovereign rights and cultural preservation. Uses specific examples (Maasai, Venice) and maintains logical consistency throughout. Arguments are well-structured and coherent. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers counter-arguments about economic benefits and sustainable tourism, but the position shifts somewhat between advocating for sustainable practices vs. opposing restrictions entirely. Less internally consistent. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Provides concrete examples (Maasai ceremonies, Venice overtourism) with specific mechanisms of harm (commodification, staged authenticity, social disruption). Score: 4\n- CON: References Japan and Bhutan as examples but provides less detail about mechanisms. Makes assertions about economic benefits without specific evidence. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's arguments, particularly turning the Japan/Bhutan examples to support their own case. Addresses the discrimination concern as a \"red herring\" and explains why economic benefits don't outweigh cultural costs. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with some PRO arguments but doesn't effectively respond to the core claim about sovereign rights. The paternalism argument is introduced late and underdeveloped. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly weighs cultural preservation as fundamental, explains why economic benefits are short-term vs. long-term cultural costs, and frames the debate around empowerment vs. erosion. Score: 4\n- CON: Discusses economic benefits and cross-cultural understanding but doesn't comparatively weigh these against PRO's cultural preservation impacts. Limited explicit weighing. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's key strength is the strategic framing that \"right to restrict\" enables sustainable practices rather than opposing them. This effectively co-opts CON's sustainable tourism argument. PRO also successfully turns CON's examples (Japan, Bhutan) by noting these countries use restrictions.\n\nCON's weakness is failing to distinguish between \"having the right to restrict\" vs. \"must restrict all tourism.\" CON argues against blanket restrictions but doesn't address why countries shouldn't have the *right* to implement targeted restrictions. The discrimination argument is underdeveloped and doesn't land effectively.\n\nPRO maintains consistent focus on sovereignty and cultural preservation throughout. CON's position appears to concede that some management is needed but doesn't explain why this shouldn't include the right to restrict.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking for dropped arguments:\n- PRO's sovereignty framing is never directly challenged\n- CON's economic argument is addressed by PRO (short-term vs. long-term)\n- PRO's turn of Japan/Bhutan examples is not refuted by CON\n- CON's discrimination concern is addressed by PRO as a red herring\n\nThe debate centers on whether countries should have the *right* to restrict. PRO successfully argues this right enables sustainable practices, while CON argues against restrictions without clearly explaining why the right itself is problematic.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins by effectively framing restrictions as enabling sustainable tourism rather than opposing it, successfully turning CON's Japan/Bhutan examples, and maintaining consistent focus on sovereign rights.
