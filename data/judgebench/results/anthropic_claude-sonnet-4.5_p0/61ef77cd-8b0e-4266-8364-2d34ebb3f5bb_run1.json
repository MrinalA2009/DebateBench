  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n**FIRST PASS EVALUATION:**\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured arguments with logical flow (discrimination prevention, public health, constitutional basis, societal benefits). Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Raises concerns about conflicts with existing rights, legal complications, and freedom of speech. Arguments are somewhat developed but rely heavily on hypothetical concerns without clear mechanisms. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific sources (HRC 2021 report with 50% discrimination statistic, APA findings on mental health), references constitutional framework (14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause). Score: 4\n- CON: Makes claims about potential conflicts and consequences but provides no specific evidence, studies, or examples. Relies primarily on assertions about what \"could\" happen. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's concerns about women's rights (jurisdictions successfully protecting both groups), Equal Protection Clause interpretation (evolution of law, link to sex discrimination), and free speech (protections don't silence dissent). Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's arguments but responses are largely dismissive (\"not convincing,\" \"overstated\") without substantive counter-evidence. Repeats initial concerns rather than deepening refutation. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Compares dignity/safety against free speech concerns, emphasizes mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation), discusses scope (50% experiencing discrimination). Score: 3\n- CON: Mentions potential erosion of rights and \"slippery slope\" but doesn't quantify or compare impacts. Claims negative consequences \"outweigh\" benefits without demonstrating why. Score: 2\n\n**SECOND PASS VERIFICATION:**\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO consistently supports claims with evidence while CON relies on speculation\n- PRO directly refutes CON's main points while CON largely restates concerns\n- PRO provides concrete examples of coexistence while CON offers hypotheticals\n- The \"slippery slope\" and \"safe spaces could be compromised\" arguments from CON lack mechanism or evidence\n\nScores remain stable.\n\n**THIRD PASS - FINAL CHECK:**\n\nWinner determination: PRO wins on superior evidence, more effective clash, and clearer impact articulation. CON's concerns about unintended consequences are not sufficiently developed or supported to overcome PRO's evidence-based case.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 - Clear winner but CON raised legitimate concerns that could have been more competitive with better support.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding (HRC statistics, APA findings) and effective refutation of CON's concerns about rights conflicts.
