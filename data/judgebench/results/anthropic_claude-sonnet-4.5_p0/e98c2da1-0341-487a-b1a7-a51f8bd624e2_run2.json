  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate through multiple passes to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n## First Pass Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with two main contentions, specific examples (Australia), and coherent framework centered on public safety. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents constitutional framework and individual rights argument, but less structured. Raises valid concerns about cultural context and unintended consequences. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Provides specific statistics (59% and 65% reductions), cites CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics, references Supreme Court case. Score: 4\n- CON: References Second Amendment and Supreme Court but provides no specific data or studies. Arguments are more theoretical. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's Second Amendment argument with Heller case, refutes cultural differences claim, challenges \"underground\" speculation. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's Australia example and regulation mechanisms, but responses are more general. Doesn't effectively counter PRO's specific statistics. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Consistently frames debate around lives saved, uses magnitude (59%, 65% reductions), emphasizes child deaths. Clear prioritization of public safety. Score: 4\n- CON: Discusses individual rights and dignity but doesn't quantify or compare impacts effectively. Less clear weighing mechanism. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO maintains consistent advantage in evidence (specific statistics vs. theoretical arguments), clash (directly addresses CON's points with case law and refutation), and weighing (quantified lives saved vs. abstract rights discussion). CON's strongest point is the constitutional framework, but they fail to provide evidence that strict regulation actually prevents self-defense or that it drives ownership underground.\n\nThe key comparative factors:\n1. PRO provides empirical evidence; CON relies on speculation\n2. PRO directly refutes CON's major claims; CON's responses are more general\n3. PRO weighs concrete lives saved; CON weighs abstract rights without showing harm from regulation\n\nWinner remains PRO with high confidence.\n\n## Final Decision\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively through superior evidence and weighing. PRO provided specific statistics showing 59-65% reductions in gun deaths post-regulation, cited credible sources, and directly refuted CON's constitutional concerns with case law. CON relied primarily on theoretical arguments about rights without quantifying harms from regulation or providing counter-evidence to PRO's empirical claims. PRO's impact weighing of lives saved outweighed CON's abstract discussion of individual liberties.\"\n}\n```",
