  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured contentions about systemic discrimination, enforcement mechanisms, and economic benefits. Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Raises concerns about unintended consequences and complexity, but arguments are somewhat less developed. The \"personal choices\" argument is presented but not deeply explored. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific statistics (82 cents on the dollar), references AAUW 2020 study, provides Iceland as concrete example. Evidence is integrated into arguments. Score: 4\n- CON: References NBER study but acknowledges it's about minimum wage (different mechanism). Less specific evidence overall. Iceland counterargument is more assertion than evidence. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's job loss claim, challenges the NBER study's relevance, refutes \"personal choices\" argument with AAUW study, attacks voluntary measures claim. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to PRO's Iceland example and purchasing power argument, but responses are more speculative (\"may not be replicable\"). Doesn't effectively counter the AAUW study's controlled findings. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Compares decades of voluntary failure vs. mandate success, weighs economic stimulation against speculative job losses, emphasizes magnitude of persistent discrimination. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions job losses and economic shock but doesn't comparatively weigh against PRO's impacts. Limited discussion of timeframe or probability. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO consistently maintains that voluntary measures have failed for decades (temporal weighing)\n- CON's job loss argument is undermined by their own admission that the NBER study focuses on minimum wage, not pay equity\n- PRO's Iceland example stands largely unrefuted beyond speculation about replicability\n- CON's \"personal choices\" argument is directly countered by PRO's controlled study evidence\n- PRO provides clearer comparative analysis throughout\n\nScores remain stable.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Check\n\nWinner determination:\n- PRO wins on evidence (controlled study vs. misapplied study)\n- PRO wins on clash (directly refutes key arguments)\n- PRO wins on weighing (clear comparative analysis)\n- Arguments roughly equal in quality, slight edge to PRO for structure\n\nThe debate turns on whether voluntary measures are sufficient. PRO establishes they've failed for decades with specific evidence, while CON's counterarguments rely on speculation about job losses without direct evidence from pay equity mandates specifically.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 (Clear winner, but CON raised legitimate complexity concerns that weren't fully dismissed)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence integration and comparative weighing.
