  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (empowerment/dignity, informed decisions, public trust). Arguments are well-structured and logically coherent throughout. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers three counter-arguments (inconsistency/bias, rehabilitation concerns, victim trauma). Arguments are clear but slightly less developed in the constructive. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References \"research shows\" victim satisfaction and closure, cites rehabilitation studies in rebuttal. Provides mechanisms (context for judges, accountability for offenders). Score: 3\n- CON: Makes claims about bias and rehabilitation but provides less specific grounding. States \"research suggests\" in rebuttal but less concrete than PRO. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses all three CON arguments in rebuttal (bias concern, rehabilitation, trauma). Provides counter-evidence and alternative framing. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's rehabilitation claim and context argument. Questions victim objectivity effectively. However, doesn't fully address the public trust argument. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Consistently frames impacts around dignity, healing, and system integrity. In summary, explicitly weighs benefits against concerns raised by CON. Score: 4\n- CON: Emphasizes fairness and rehabilitation as core values. In summary, attempts comparative weighing (\"benefits are outweighed by risks\"). Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- PRO establishes three independent arguments\n- CON challenges with systemic concerns about fairness\n- PRO responds that current system already has bias, victim input adds context\n- CON counters that victims seek revenge, not justice\n- Both sides attempt final weighing\n\nKey moments:\n1. PRO's claim that victim input enhances rehabilitation (supported by accountability mechanism)\n2. CON's challenge that victims are emotionally invested and may seek revenge\n3. PRO's response that current system isn't bias-free anyway\n4. CON's point about \"willingness to accept responsibility\" being key to rehabilitation\n\nThe clash centers on whether victim input creates more problems (bias, inconsistency) than it solves (empowerment, informed decisions).\n\nPRO more effectively:\n- Responds to all major CON arguments\n- Provides mechanisms for claims\n- Maintains consistent impact framing\n- Addresses the \"bias\" concern by noting current system has bias too\n\nCON effectively:\n- Raises legitimate systemic concerns\n- Questions victim objectivity\n- But leaves public trust argument largely unaddressed\n- Provides less specific evidence/mechanisms\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking winner determination:\n- PRO engaged more comprehensively with opponent's case\n- PRO provided slightly better grounding for claims\n- Both had similar argument quality\n- PRO had clearer comparative weighing\n\nThe debate is competitive, but PRO edges ahead on clash and weighing.\n\nConfidence: 0.65 (clear but contestable - CON raised strong concerns about fairness, but PRO's responses and more comprehensive engagement tip the balance)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on superior clash and weighing. PRO directly addressed all three CON arguments with mechanisms and counter-evidence, while CON left the public trust argument largely unaddressed. PRO's response that the current system already contains bias effectively neutralized CON's fairness concerns, and PRO provided clearer comparative impact analysis throughout.\"\n}\n```",
