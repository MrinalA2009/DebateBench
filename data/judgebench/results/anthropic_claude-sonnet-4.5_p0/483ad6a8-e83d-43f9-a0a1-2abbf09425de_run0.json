  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate through multiple passes to ensure consistency.\n\n## First Pass Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with three contentions (transparency, bias mitigation, democratic protection). Arguments are well-organized and logically coherent. Score: 4\n- CON: Four distinct arguments (privacy, complexity, manipulation, alternative solutions). Coherent but somewhat reactive. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Pew Research (68% statistic), ProPublica COMPAS investigation. Uses concrete examples and mechanisms. Score: 4\n- CON: Relies more on theoretical concerns without specific citations or data. Arguments are logical but less grounded. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses all CON arguments (privacy via differential privacy, complexity via expert capability, manipulation via independent bodies). Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's points but responses are more defensive. Reiterates concerns without fully dismantling PRO's solutions. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Frames debate as \"black boxes vs. accountability,\" emphasizes societal impact, democracy, and equity. Clear comparative weighing in summary. Score: 4\n- CON: Focuses on risks but doesn't effectively weigh them against PRO's impacts. Less comparative analysis. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO consistently provides mechanisms (differential privacy, synthetic data, independent bodies) to address CON's concerns\n- CON raises valid concerns but doesn't adequately respond to PRO's technical solutions\n- PRO's evidence (Pew, ProPublica) vs CON's theoretical arguments creates an imbalance\n- PRO's framing of \"insufficient alternatives\" effectively undermines CON's best practices argument\n- CON's privacy concerns are addressed but CON doesn't acknowledge or counter PRO's solutions effectively\n\nScores remain stable across both passes.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins through superior evidence, more effective clash, and better impact weighing. PRO provided concrete solutions to CON's concerns (differential privacy for privacy, expert analysis for complexity, independent bodies for manipulation), while CON largely reiterated concerns without adequately engaging with these solutions. PRO's evidence base and comparative weighing (\"accountability over opacity\") created a clearer path to the ballot.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence (Pew, ProPublica) and more effective clash.
