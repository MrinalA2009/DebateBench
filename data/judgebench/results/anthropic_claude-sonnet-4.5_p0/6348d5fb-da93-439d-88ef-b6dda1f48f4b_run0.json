  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured arguments (youth responsibilities, civic engagement, information access, equality principle). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers well-structured counterarguments focusing on maturity, civic education gaps, and electoral integrity. Logical and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Austria and Scotland as examples, references studies on habit formation and youth engagement, but lacks specific data. Some assertions about cognitive development. Score: 3\n- CON: Points to civic education differences between countries, discusses complexity of voting decisions, but also relies heavily on general assertions about maturity without specific evidence. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's maturity concerns, engages with civic education argument, responds to misinformation point. Effective engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Systematically refutes PRO's maturity argument, challenges the Austria/Scotland comparison, addresses the civic education sequencing. Strong direct engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes long-term democratic engagement, generational representation, and equality principles. Some comparative weighing but could be stronger. Score: 3\n- CON: Focuses on electoral integrity and informed participation as paramount concerns. Weighs risks vs. benefits but less explicit comparative analysis. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's strongest moment: Turning the civic education concern into a reason to lower the age while improving education simultaneously.\n\nCON's strongest moment: The \"cart before horse\" argument about implementing civic education before lowering the voting age.\n\nKey dropped arguments: Neither side fully dropped major arguments, but CON more effectively challenged PRO's empirical claims about Austria/Scotland by noting systemic differences.\n\nThe debate is very close. Both sides engaged well, but CON slightly edges out by:\n1. More effectively challenging the applicability of PRO's international examples\n2. Stronger logical sequencing argument (education first, then voting rights)\n3. Better risk assessment regarding electoral integrity\n\n## Final Consistency Check\n\nWinner determination: CON wins narrowly based on superior logical sequencing argument and more effective challenge to PRO's empirical claims. The \"cart before horse\" framing was particularly effective and not adequately answered by PRO.\n\nConfidence: 0.55 - This is a close debate with strong performances on both sides.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.55,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins narrowly by effectively challenging PRO's international examples as inapplicable due to civic education differences and presenting a stronger logical sequencing argument that education must precede voting rights expansion. CON's 'cart before horse' framing regarding civic education was particularly effective and inadequately answered by PRO's simultaneous implementation proposal.\"\n}\n```",
