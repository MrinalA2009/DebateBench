  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear structure with three main contentions (health outcomes, parental support, societal implications). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Equally clear structure with three contentions (government overreach, enforcement problems, educational benefits). Well-articulated and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines with specific age recommendations. Links screen time to obesity, sleep issues, and mental health. Provides concrete support. Score: 4\n- CON: Uses logical reasoning about enforcement challenges and parental autonomy. Less empirical evidence but strong mechanistic arguments about practical implementation. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Addresses autonomy concerns by reframing as \"support not infringement.\" Responds to enforcement by comparing to substance regulation. Engages opponent's points. Score: 3\n- CON: Directly challenges PRO's AAP citation by distinguishing guidelines from laws. Points out contradiction in \"not one-size-fits-all\" while proposing legal mandate. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes public health crisis, protection of children, but limited comparative weighing against CON's concerns. Score: 3\n- CON: Explicitly weighs \"governmental intrusion\" and \"erosion of parental rights\" against \"generalized concerns.\" Clear comparative framework in summary. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- CON effectively exploits the tension between PRO's claim of flexibility and the inherent rigidity of legal mandates\n- PRO's enforcement response (comparing to substance laws) doesn't adequately address the surveillance concerns\n- CON's distinction between guidelines and laws is a strong analytical point that PRO doesn't fully overcome\n- PRO drops the educational benefits argument in later speeches\n- CON maintains consistent focus on practical implementation problems\n\nThe key clash is whether public health concerns justify legal intervention despite autonomy/enforcement issues. CON more effectively demonstrates why the costs outweigh benefits through practical analysis.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking for stability:\n- CON wins clash (4 vs 3) by more directly engaging and refuting\n- CON wins weighing (4 vs 3) through explicit comparative analysis\n- Evidence favors PRO (4 vs 3) with AAP citations\n- Argument quality tied (4 vs 4)\n\nCON's superior engagement with PRO's core claims and clearer impact comparison outweighs PRO's stronger evidentiary foundation. The practical enforcement critique remains largely unrefuted.\n\nWinner: CON\nConfidence: 0.7 (clear but contestable - PRO had strong health evidence but weaker responses to implementation challenges)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior clash and weighing. CON effectively exploited the contradiction between PRO's claimed flexibility and legal mandates' inherent rigidity, while PRO inadequately addressed enforcement concerns. CON's explicit comparative weighing of governmental intrusion against health benefits, combined with the unrefuted practical implementation critique, outweighed PRO's stronger empirical evidence on health harms.\"\n}\n```",
