  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured arguments around autonomy and suffering. Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents slippery slope, palliative care alternatives, and safeguard concerns. Arguments are clear but the slippery slope relies heavily on one example. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs and Dr. Marcia Angell. Uses specific examples and mechanisms. Score: 4\n- CON: References Netherlands/Belgium as evidence but lacks specific citations or data. More assertion-based than PRO. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses slippery slope as fallacy, challenges palliative care claims with \"not a panacea\" argument, responds to safeguard concerns. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's points but largely restates original position. Doesn't effectively counter the autonomy argument or address the \"last resort\" framing. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Frames assisted suicide as \"last resort\" when palliative care fails, weighs individual autonomy against hypothetical future harms. Clear comparative weighing. Score: 4\n- CON: Emphasizes protecting vulnerable populations and human dignity, but doesn't comparatively weigh against PRO's autonomy/suffering impacts. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO consistently returns to autonomy and intractable suffering as core impacts\n- CON's slippery slope argument is challenged as fallacy and not adequately defended with comparative analysis\n- PRO's \"last resort\" framing (not replacing palliative care) is never directly refuted\n- CON doesn't engage with the autonomy argument substantively\n- PRO provides more specific evidence (named sources vs. country examples without data)\n\nThe scores remain stable.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins on stronger evidence, more effective clash, and clearer impact weighing. The autonomy argument stands largely uncontested, and PRO successfully frames assisted suicide as complementary to (not replacing) palliative care. CON's slippery slope argument is weakened when PRO identifies it as a logical fallacy and CON doesn't provide sufficient comparative weighing to overcome PRO's core impacts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence (specific citations vs. general examples), more effective clash (directly refuting slippery slope as fallacy), and clearer impact weighing (last resort framing).
