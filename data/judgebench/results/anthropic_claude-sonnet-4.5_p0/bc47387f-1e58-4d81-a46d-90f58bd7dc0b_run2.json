  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured arguments around autonomy and suffering. Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents slippery slope, palliative care alternatives, and safeguard concerns. Arguments are clear but the slippery slope relies heavily on one example. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs and Dr. Marcia Angell. Uses specific examples and medical authority. Score: 4\n- CON: References Netherlands/Belgium as evidence but lacks specific citations or data. More assertion-based than PRO. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses slippery slope as fallacy, challenges palliative care claims with \"not a panacea\" argument, responds to safeguard concerns. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's points on palliative care and safeguards, but doesn't effectively counter the autonomy argument or address PRO's evidence. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly weighs individual autonomy and relief from suffering as primary impacts. Frames assisted suicide as \"last resort\" when other options fail. Score: 4\n- CON: Weighs protection of vulnerable populations and value of human life, but doesn't comparatively weigh why these outweigh individual autonomy. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO consistently returns to autonomy as a fundamental right that CON never directly refutes\n- CON's slippery slope argument is challenged as a fallacy by PRO, and CON doesn't provide sufficient defense beyond citing examples\n- PRO's evidence is more specific and authoritative\n- CON's palliative care argument is weakened by PRO's acknowledgment that it's valuable but insufficient for some cases\n- PRO engages more directly with CON's arguments while CON often restates positions\n\nThe scores remain stable across both passes.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins on stronger evidence, more effective clash, and clearer impact weighing. The autonomy argument remains largely uncontested, and PRO successfully frames assisted suicide as a last resort rather than replacement for palliative care. CON's slippery slope argument is effectively challenged as fallacious, and the palliative care alternative doesn't address cases of intractable suffering.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through stronger evidence (AMA, Dr. Angell citations), more effective refutation of slippery slope as fallacy, and clearer impact weighing on autonomy.
