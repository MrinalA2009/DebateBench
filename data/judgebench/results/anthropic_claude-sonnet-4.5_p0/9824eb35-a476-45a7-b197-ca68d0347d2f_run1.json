  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate through multiple passes to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presented clear framework (public health, harm reduction, social justice) with two well-structured contentions. Arguments were coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Offered counterarguments but relied heavily on questioning PRO's evidence rather than building independent case. Framework mentioned but less developed. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cited specific sources (British Journal of Criminology, Cato Institute) and Portugal case study with concrete claims about outcomes (reduced deaths, HIV infections). Score: 4\n- CON: Acknowledged Portugal but provided no independent evidence or studies. Made claims about \"potential\" consequences without supporting data. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addressed CON's Portugal critique, youth drug use concern, and systemic inequality argument with specific rebuttals. Score: 4\n- CON: Engaged with PRO's Portugal example but primarily through speculation rather than counter-evidence. Questioned implementation without offering alternatives. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly articulated impacts (preventable deaths, disease spread, mass incarceration) and compared current system's harms to decriminalization benefits. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentioned \"unintended consequences\" and \"vulnerable populations\" but failed to quantify or compare these impacts against status quo harms. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. Portugal model: PRO provided evidence of success; CON questioned replicability but offered no counter-evidence\n2. Youth drug use: PRO cited studies showing no increase; CON speculated about \"long-term effects\" without support\n3. Resource allocation: PRO explained mechanism; CON called it \"not straightforward\" without explanation\n4. Systemic inequalities: Both acknowledged issue; PRO explained how decriminalization enables solutions; CON offered no alternative\n\nCON's strongest argument was about implementation complexity, but this was undermined by lack of evidence and failure to weigh against status quo harms that PRO established.\n\n## Final Consistency Check\n\nWinner determination: PRO won on evidence superiority, clearer impact weighing, and more effective clash. CON's case relied primarily on speculation and questioning without substantive counter-evidence or impact comparison.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 - Clear winner but CON raised legitimate questions about implementation that weren't fully resolved, preventing this from being a decisive victory.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won through superior evidence grounding, citing specific studies showing Portugal's success in reducing deaths and HIV infections.
