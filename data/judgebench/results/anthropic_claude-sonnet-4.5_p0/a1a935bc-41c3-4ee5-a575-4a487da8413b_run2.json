  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear arguments about cultural preservation and national sovereignty. Uses Bali and Bhutan as examples. Arguments are coherent but somewhat repetitive. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers three distinct contentions (cultural exchange, economic harm, dynamic culture). Well-structured and logically developed. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Provides specific examples (Bali's temple commercialization, Bhutan's policy). However, lacks detailed mechanisms or data. Score: 3\n- CON: References the same examples but provides more analytical depth about economic dependencies and cultural dynamics. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's arguments about cultural exchange and economics. Distinguishes between unregulated vs. restricted tourism. Score: 4\n- CON: Effectively challenges PRO's examples by distinguishing \"unmanaged\" vs. \"tourism itself.\" Addresses the static culture critique directly. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes cultural preservation and future generations but doesn't comparatively weigh against CON's economic/exchange impacts. Score: 3\n- CON: Explicitly weighs economic lifelines, cultural evolution, and global understanding against PRO's preservation claims. More comparative analysis. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- CON consistently makes the distinction between \"unmanaged tourism\" and \"tourism itself,\" which PRO never fully addresses\n- PRO's main examples (Bali) actually support CON's point about needing regulation, not restriction\n- CON provides clearer impact comparison (economic lifelines, cultural stagnation vs. evolution)\n- PRO's \"high-value, low-impact\" model is acknowledged as limited even by PRO\n- CON's argument about cultural dynamism vs. museum-like preservation is not effectively refuted\n\nThe key debate turning point: CON successfully argues that PRO conflates \"unregulated tourism\" with \"tourism\" generally, and that regulation (not restriction) is the solution. PRO never adequately responds to this distinction.\n\n## Final Scores Confirmation\n\nAfter two passes, my scores remain stable:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by successfully distinguishing unmanaged tourism from tourism itself, arguing regulation over restriction addresses PRO's harms while preserving economic and cultural exchange benefits. CON provided superior impact weighing, comparing economic lifelines and cultural dynamism against PRO's preservation claims. PRO never adequately refuted the managed-tourism alternative, making their restriction framework unnecessary.\"\n}\n```",
