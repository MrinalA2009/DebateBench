  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents a clear thesis with logical structure. Arguments flow coherently from criminalization's failures to decriminalization's benefits. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-structured counterarguments with clear contentions about public safety and implementation challenges. Maintains internal consistency. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Portuguese model with specific outcomes (decreased overdose deaths, HIV infections). References harm reduction programs and medication-assisted treatment. Score: 4\n- CON: Provides Oregon Measure 110 as counter-evidence with specific outcomes (increased overdose deaths, public drug use). Makes distinction about Portugal's infrastructure requirements. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Addresses CON's Portugal critique but doesn't adequately respond to Oregon example or infrastructure concerns. Dismisses crime argument without fully engaging the mechanism. Score: 3\n- CON: Directly engages PRO's Portugal example by highlighting infrastructure requirements. Systematically refutes PRO's dismissal of Oregon evidence. Addresses the \"correlation vs causation\" claim. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Identifies benefits (reduced deaths, improved health outcomes, resource efficiency) but doesn't comparatively weigh against CON's safety concerns. Score: 3\n- CON: Explicitly weighs societal costs (crime, emergency visits, lost productivity) against benefits. Frames the debate around implementation feasibility. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- CON's Oregon example stands largely unrefuted - PRO dismisses it but doesn't explain why the evidence is invalid\n- PRO's Portugal model is challenged on replicability grounds, which PRO doesn't adequately address\n- CON consistently returns to the infrastructure requirement, which PRO never provides a plan for\n- CON's public safety mechanism (removal of deterrents \u2192 increased availability \u2192 more crime) is called \"oversimplification\" by PRO but not dismantled\n\nThe critical dropped argument is CON's challenge about implementation infrastructure. PRO never explains how to replicate Portugal's success without the robust support system CON identifies as essential.\n\n## Final Consistency Check\n\nWinner: CON wins on superior clash and weighing. CON effectively neutralized PRO's Portugal evidence by highlighting the infrastructure distinction, provided counter-evidence with Oregon that PRO failed to adequately refute, and maintained clearer comparative weighing throughout.\n\nConfidence: 0.72 - Clear winner but PRO had strong initial arguments that made this competitive.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior clash and weighing.
