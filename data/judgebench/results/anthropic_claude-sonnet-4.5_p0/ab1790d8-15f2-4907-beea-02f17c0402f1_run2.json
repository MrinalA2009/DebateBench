  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate through multiple passes to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear environmental concerns but relies heavily on assertion. Arguments are coherent but somewhat repetitive across speeches. Score: 3\n- CON: Provides structured contentions with clear links between mineral demand, renewable energy, and deep-sea mining. More strategic framing. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites NOAA report (90% species loss) and European Commission report on recycling. Limited integration and specificity. Score: 3\n- CON: References IEA projections, ISA regulatory framework, and specific minerals (nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese). Better contextualization. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Engages CON's arguments but primarily through assertion (\"false dichotomy,\" \"misleading\"). Limited substantive refutation of the mineral demand argument. Score: 3\n- CON: Directly addresses PRO's recycling alternative, challenges the \"false dichotomy\" claim, and compares terrestrial vs. deep-sea mining impacts. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes long-term ecosystem preservation and \"unforeseen consequences\" but doesn't comparatively weigh against CON's climate change impact. Score: 2\n- CON: Explicitly weighs climate change as \"far greater environmental threat\" and compares terrestrial mining costs. Clear comparative framework. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. **Alternatives debate**: CON effectively argues recycling is insufficient and PRO doesn't provide scalable alternatives\n2. **Regulation**: PRO dismisses ISA as \"in infancy\" but CON defends its development with specifics\n3. **Impact comparison**: CON consistently frames deep-sea mining as necessary for preventing worse climate impacts; PRO focuses on ecosystem loss but doesn't weigh this against climate change\n\nThe scores remain consistent across passes.\n\n## Final Decision\n\nCON wins through superior impact weighing and more effective engagement with the core tension of the debate. CON successfully framed the choice as between deep-sea mining risks versus climate change (characterized as a \"far greater environmental threat\"), while PRO failed to adequately weigh ecosystem preservation against this framing. CON also more effectively challenged PRO's recycling alternative as insufficient for meeting global demand, while PRO largely asserted rather than proved the viability of alternatives.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing, framing deep-sea mining as necessary to prevent climate change\u2014a 'far greater environmental threat.'
