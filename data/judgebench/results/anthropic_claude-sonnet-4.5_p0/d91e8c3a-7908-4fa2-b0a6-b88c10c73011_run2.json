  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear pillars (accessibility, efficiency, satisfaction) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents three counter-arguments (diagnostic accuracy, relationships, comprehensive care) with clear structure. Arguments are logical and well-developed. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites American Journal of Managed Care (50% access increase), Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare (half the time), Pew Research (76% satisfaction), American Telemedicine Association. Specific statistics strengthen claims. Score: 4\n- CON: Cites Journal of General Internal Medicine, American Medical Association, Journal of Family Medicine (75% diagnoses from physical exam), National Academy of Medicine. Strong evidence integration. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: In rebuttal, directly addresses all three CON arguments (diagnostic accuracy, relationships, comprehensive care). Proposes hybrid model and AI tools as solutions. Engages substantively. Score: 4\n- CON: In rebuttal, directly counters PRO's responses point-by-point. Challenges the 75% physical exam statistic against PRO's claims. Strong engagement with opponent's arguments. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes magnitude (millions in rural areas), efficiency gains (half the time), and patient outcomes. In summary, explicitly weighs accessibility as \"necessity for equitable healthcare\" and connects satisfaction to health outcomes. Score: 3\n- CON: Focuses on risk magnitude (misdiagnosis, compromised care quality). In summary, explicitly frames debate as \"trade-off between convenience and quality of care\" and argues risks outweigh benefits. Clearer comparative weighing. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- Both sides maintain consistent argument quality and evidence standards\n- CON's weighing in the summary is more explicit about the trade-off framework\n- CON directly challenges PRO's hybrid model by noting it \"acknowledges the limitations of telemedicine\"\n- PRO's claim that telemedicine \"enhances\" rather than \"replaces\" creates tension with the resolution itself\n- CON maintains focus on the resolution's language (\"replace most\") throughout\n\nThe key clash point: PRO shifts to a \"hybrid\" or \"complement\" model in rebuttal, which CON effectively exploits as inconsistent with \"replacing most routine visits.\"\n\n## Final Determination\n\nCON wins on superior impact weighing and more effective exploitation of PRO's strategic concession to a hybrid model. While both sides performed strongly on argument quality and evidence, CON's clearer comparative framework and successful challenge to PRO's position shift provides the edge.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing, explicitly framing the debate as a quality-versus-convenience trade-off. CON effectively exploited PRO's shift to a hybrid model, which contradicts the resolution's call to 'replace most' visits. Both sides presented strong evidence and clash, but CON's clearer comparative framework and consistent position on the resolution provided the decisive edge.\"\n}\n```",
