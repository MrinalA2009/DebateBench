  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with two main contentions (environmental impact, social inequity). Arguments are logically coherent and well-developed. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents economic, essential functions, and innovation arguments. However, the rebuttal appears to contradict the constructive by agreeing with PRO's points about job redirection and minimal essential use. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific 2023 Transport & Environment report with concrete pollution comparisons (5-14x worse than commercial, 50x worse than trains). Score: 4\n- CON: Makes claims about economic contributions and jobs but provides no specific data or sources. Relies on general assertions. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's economic argument (calls it \"red herring\"), challenges essential functions claim with specifics, and attacks the timeline issue of green tech. Score: 4\n- CON: The rebuttal is problematic - it appears to concede PRO's points (\"the assertion that private jets serve essential functions is misleading,\" \"these do not justify the environmental impact\"). This is self-contradictory. Score: 2\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly weighs environmental urgency against economic concerns, emphasizes timeline (\"we cannot wait\"), and frames the debate around immediate vs. future action. Score: 4\n- CON: Attempts weighing but undermines own position in rebuttal. Doesn't effectively compare magnitude of impacts. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing CON's rebuttal more carefully: CON states \"the economic argument overlooks the reality\" and then argues PRO's point about redirecting resources creating more jobs. CON also states private jets serving essential functions \"is misleading\" and that \"these do not justify the environmental impact.\" This appears to be a critical error where CON concedes major ground.\n\nPRO maintains consistency throughout, builds on arguments effectively, and provides the only concrete evidence in the debate.\n\n**Scores remain:**\n- Argument Quality: PRO 4, CON 3\n- Evidence: PRO 4, CON 2\n- Clash: PRO 4, CON 2\n- Weighing: PRO 4, CON 2\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nThe most significant factor is CON's self-contradictory rebuttal that appears to concede PRO's main arguments. Combined with PRO's superior evidence (specific cited report vs. no sources from CON) and clearer impact weighing (immediate action vs. waiting for future tech), PRO wins decisively.\n\nConfidence: 0.85 (Clear winner, though CON's rebuttal confusion creates some interpretive uncertainty about intent)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively through superior evidence (cited Transport & Environment report vs. unsourced claims), effective weighing of immediate climate action against speculative future solutions, and strong refutation. CON's rebuttal critically undermines their own position by conceding that private jets' essential functions are 'misleading' and economic arguments are flawed, while providing no concrete data to support their claims.\"\n}\n```",
