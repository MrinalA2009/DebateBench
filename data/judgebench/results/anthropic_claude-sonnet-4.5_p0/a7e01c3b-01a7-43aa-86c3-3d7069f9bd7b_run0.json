  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with two main contentions (environmental impact, social inequity). Arguments are logically coherent and well-developed. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents economic, essential functions, and innovation arguments. However, the rebuttal appears to contradict the constructive by agreeing with PRO's points about job redirection and minimal essential use. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific 2023 Transport & Environment report with concrete pollution comparisons (5-14x commercial planes, 50x trains). Well-integrated evidence. Score: 5\n- CON: Makes claims about economic contribution and jobs but provides no specific data or sources. Relies on general assertions. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's economic argument (calling it a \"red herring\"), challenges the essential functions claim with specifics, and attacks the green technology timeline argument. Score: 5\n- CON: The rebuttal is problematic - it appears to concede PRO's points (\"the economic argument overlooks the reality...Redirecting resources...can create far more jobs\") while trying to argue against the ban. Minimal effective refutation. Score: 2\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly weighs immediate climate action against speculative future solutions, emphasizes magnitude of environmental harm versus limited economic benefits, and frames the debate around urgency. Score: 5\n- CON: Attempts some weighing around economic impacts and innovation potential, but doesn't effectively compare magnitudes or explain why their impacts outweigh PRO's climate concerns. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the CON rebuttal more carefully: CON's rebuttal actually appears to agree with PRO's arguments (\"Redirecting resources from this luxury industry to sustainable public transportation can create far more jobs...\"). This is a critical concession that undermines CON's position.\n\nPRO maintains consistency throughout, with clear impact weighing on climate urgency versus delayed technological solutions.\n\n**Scores remain:**\n- Argument Quality: PRO 4, CON 3\n- Evidence: PRO 5, CON 2\n- Clash: PRO 5, CON 2\n- Weighing: PRO 5, CON 3\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nThe key factors:\n1. PRO provides concrete evidence; CON does not\n2. CON's rebuttal contains apparent concessions to PRO's framework\n3. PRO effectively weighs immediate action vs. future speculation\n4. CON fails to adequately defend against the \"red herring\" and \"exaggeration\" attacks\n\nWinner: PRO with high confidence (0.85)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively through superior evidence (specific Transport & Environment data vs. unsupported assertions), effective refutation of CON's economic and essential functions arguments, and clear impact weighing on climate urgency.
