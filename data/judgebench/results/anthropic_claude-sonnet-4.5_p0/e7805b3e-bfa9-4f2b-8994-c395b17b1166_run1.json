  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear structure with main claims about cognitive maturity, existing responsibilities, and civic education. Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Also presents clear structure focusing on cognitive development concerns, engagement effectiveness, and electoral integrity. Well-organized counterarguments. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References National Center for Education Statistics study, cites Scotland and Austria as examples, mentions civic education classes. Provides specific support for claims. Score: 4\n- CON: Cites \"Developmental Psychology\" journal, references Austria and Scotland data, discusses research on cognitive development. Comparable evidence quality. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's cognitive development argument, challenges the Austria/Scotland interpretation, responds to populist rhetoric concern. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Directly refutes PRO's maturity claims, challenges civic education effectiveness, contests the Austria/Scotland examples. Equally strong engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes benefits of inclusivity, civic engagement, and youth voice on issues affecting them. Some comparative weighing but could be stronger. Score: 3\n- CON: Focuses on electoral integrity, informed decision-making, and societal stability. Argues risks outweigh benefits explicitly. Slightly stronger weighing. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nRe-examining the debate:\n\nThe key clash points are:\n1. Cognitive maturity - CON emphasizes mid-20s development; PRO argues 16-year-olds already make significant decisions\n2. Austria/Scotland examples - Both cite these but interpret differently\n3. Civic education effectiveness - PRO says it prepares youth; CON says knowledge \u2260 informed voting\n4. Electoral integrity concerns - CON emphasizes risks; PRO says risks apply to all ages\n\nCON's argument about cognitive development (impulse control, long-term planning) is more specific and directly challenges PRO's equivalence between life decisions and voting. CON also provides a clearer risk-benefit analysis in the final summary, explicitly stating \"risks far outweigh benefits.\"\n\nPRO's rebuttal that concerns apply to \"all ages\" is somewhat defensive and doesn't fully address why 16 is the appropriate threshold. CON maintains focus on the specific vulnerabilities of this age group.\n\nCON's weighing is more explicit and comparative, particularly in the final summary where they prioritize \"informed decision-making\" and \"electoral integrity\" over increased participation.\n\n## Final Judgment\n\nAfter two passes, CON edges ahead primarily on impact weighing and the strength of their cognitive development argument, which PRO never fully overcame. CON maintained clearer comparative analysis throughout.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior impact weighing, explicitly comparing risks versus benefits and prioritizing electoral integrity. While both sides presented strong arguments and evidence, CON's cognitive development argument remained more specific and unrefuted, and their final comparative analysis was clearer. PRO's response that concerns apply to all ages was insufficient to overcome CON's focused critique of 16-year-old vulnerabilities.\"\n}\n```",
