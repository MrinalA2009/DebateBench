  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (societal impact, economic consequences, ethical implications) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers three distinct contentions (individual freedom, public revenue, black market concerns) that are clearly articulated and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites National Council on Problem Gambling (2M pathological gamblers, 4-6M problem gamblers), University of Massachusetts study ($3 social cost per $1 revenue). Specific statistics strengthen claims. Score: 4\n- CON: References North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries ($29B in proceeds, 2022). Challenges PRO's study methodology but doesn't provide counter-evidence. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses freedom argument by highlighting addiction reality, challenges economic benefits with cost analysis, responds to black market concern. Engages opponent's major points. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to addiction argument with \"nanny state\" framing, challenges study methodology, addresses prohibition concerns. However, doesn't fully engage with the $3:$1 cost ratio claim beyond calling it \"outdated.\" Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Consistently emphasizes magnitude (2M pathological gamblers, $3 in costs per $1 revenue), connects to broader societal harms (bankruptcy, domestic violence, suicide). Clear comparative weighing throughout. Score: 4\n- CON: Argues freedom and economic benefits outweigh harms, mentions \"vast majority of responsible adults,\" but doesn't quantify or directly compare magnitude of impacts against PRO's specific numbers. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- PRO establishes concrete harms with specific statistics\n- CON challenges methodology but doesn't provide competing evidence\n- PRO's $3:$1 cost ratio is challenged as \"outdated\" but not refuted with alternative data\n- CON's strongest point (individual freedom) is met with PRO's addiction argument\n- PRO maintains consistent impact comparison throughout\n\nThe key clash is whether individual freedom outweighs documented social costs. PRO provides specific quantification ($3:$1 ratio, 2M pathological gamblers), while CON relies more on principle-based arguments without comparable evidence.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins on superior evidence grounding and impact weighing. While CON makes valid philosophical points about freedom, PRO's specific cost-benefit analysis and addiction statistics create a more concrete case. CON's challenge to study methodology without providing counter-evidence weakens their economic argument.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence and impact weighing.
