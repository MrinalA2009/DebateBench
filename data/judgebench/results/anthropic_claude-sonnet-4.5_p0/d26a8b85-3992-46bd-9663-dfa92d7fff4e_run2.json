  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n**FIRST PASS EVALUATION:**\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (conflict/violence, impeding social progress, intellectual stagnation). Arguments are logically structured and internally consistent. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents two main contentions (moral framework/altruism, social cohesion). Arguments are coherent but less developed than PRO's. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Provides specific examples (ISIS, Boko Haram), references concrete issues (reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ discrimination, stem cell research). Well-integrated support. Score: 4\n- CON: References studies and charitable work generally, but lacks specific examples or data. More assertion-based. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's \"misinterpretation\" argument, challenges the charity claim with conditional aid argument, addresses the moral framework claim with secular alternatives. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to PRO's points but often with general defenses rather than specific refutations. The \"throwing baby out with bathwater\" argument doesn't directly address PRO's systemic harm claims. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs impacts in summary (\"widespread violence, human rights abuses, and suppression of critical thought...far outweigh the localized benefits\"). Provides magnitude and scope comparison. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions \"billions of people\" but doesn't comparatively weigh against PRO's harms. Limited explicit weighing. Score: 2\n\n**SECOND PASS VERIFICATION:**\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO consistently maintains that harms are systemic and inherent, not exceptional\n- CON's main defense is that harms are misinterpretations, but doesn't adequately address PRO's counterargument that these stem from the texts themselves\n- PRO's weighing argument (systemic global harms vs. localized benefits) is largely uncontested\n- CON drops PRO's third contention about intellectual stagnation entirely\n\n**THIRD PASS - FINAL CHECK:**\n\nWinner determination: PRO wins on superior clash, explicit weighing, and better evidence integration. CON's failure to adequately respond to the \"inherent vs. misinterpretation\" debate and lack of comparative weighing are decisive.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 - Clear winner but CON made reasonable arguments that could resonate with some judges.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior impact weighing and clash. PRO effectively argued harms are systemic rather than misinterpretations, provided specific examples, and explicitly weighed widespread global harms against localized benefits. CON failed to comparatively weigh impacts or adequately address PRO's core systemic harm argument, relying primarily on general defenses.\"\n}\n```",
