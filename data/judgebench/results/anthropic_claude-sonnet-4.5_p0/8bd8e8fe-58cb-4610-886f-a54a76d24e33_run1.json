  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (cognitive, economic, cultural) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents resource strain, linguistic diversity, and voluntary alternatives. Arguments are clear but somewhat repetitive across speeches. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific research (Dr. Bialystok's 2012 study, Brain and Language journal, ACTFL), provides concrete claims (4.5 year dementia delay, 350+ languages). Score: 4\n- CON: References general facts (350 languages, overcrowded classrooms) but lacks specific studies or data to support claims about resource strain or cognitive benefit disputes. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses resource strain as \"false dilemma,\" refutes one-size-fits-all by explaining flexibility, challenges CON's dismissal of cognitive benefits with research consensus. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's points but largely reasserts original arguments without substantively refuting PRO's evidence or mechanisms. Doesn't address the Bialystok study specifically. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs long-term benefits against short-term costs, frames choice as \"short-sighted concerns vs. long-term prosperity,\" connects cognitive benefits to STEM performance. Score: 4\n- CON: Emphasizes \"immediate challenges\" and \"pressing reality\" but doesn't comparatively weigh against PRO's long-term impacts or explain why short-term concerns outweigh cognitive/economic benefits. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO maintains consistent evidence advantage (specific studies vs. general assertions)\n- CON's resource strain argument is never quantified or compared to PRO's economic benefits\n- PRO's rebuttal effectively neutralizes the \"one-size-fits-all\" concern by explaining flexibility\n- CON doesn't adequately respond to the dementia study or cognitive flexibility claims\n- PRO provides clearer comparative weighing in summary\n\n## Final Judgment\n\nPRO wins through superior evidence grounding and impact weighing. The specific citation of Dr. Bialystok's research with quantifiable benefits (4.5 year dementia delay) versus CON's unsupported assertions about resource strain creates a significant evidentiary gap. PRO's explanation that mandatory doesn't mean uniform language choice effectively answers CON's diversity concern. CON's failure to comparatively weigh immediate costs against long-term cognitive and economic benefits leaves PRO's impact calculus largely uncontested.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding, citing specific research with quantifiable benefits while CON relies on unsupported assertions.
