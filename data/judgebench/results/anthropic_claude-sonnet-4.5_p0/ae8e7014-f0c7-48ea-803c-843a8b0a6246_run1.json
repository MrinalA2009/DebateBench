  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear structure with three main contentions (climate science, implementation through carbon pricing, equity). Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Well-structured response addressing economic impacts, equity concerns, and alternative solutions. Clear logical flow throughout. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific statistic (2.5% of global emissions, projected to triple by 2050). References carbon pricing mechanism and sustainable aviation technologies. Score: 3\n- CON: References specific examples (Airbus hydrogen aircraft, SAF production). Provides concrete alternatives and mentions comparative emissions across sectors. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's economic arguments, addresses freedom/equity concerns, and responds to technology-focused critique. Score: 4\n- CON: Systematically dismantles PRO's equity argument, challenges carbon pricing as regressive, and directly refutes the dismissal of technological solutions. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Compares long-term climate costs vs. short-term economic impacts. Argues urgency requires immediate action beyond technology. Score: 3\n- CON: Emphasizes disproportionate economic harm vs. minimal environmental gain. Weighs developing nations' impacts and compares aviation to other emission sectors. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- CON effectively turned PRO's equity argument by showing carbon pricing creates wealth-based access\n- PRO's urgency argument was partially undermined by CON's evidence of ongoing technological progress\n- CON provided more specific comparative weighing (economic devastation vs. minimal gain, aviation's small percentage)\n- PRO's dropped CON's point about aviation being relatively small compared to other sectors\n\n## Final Scores and Decision\n\nCON demonstrated stronger comparative weighing, more specific evidence integration, and effectively turned PRO's equity framework. While both sides clashed well, CON's argument that rationing creates regressive outcomes while technology offers viable alternatives was more compelling within the debate's constraints.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior impact weighing and evidence integration.
