  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear structure with main claims about cognitive maturity, existing responsibilities, and civic education. Arguments are coherent and logically connected. Score: 4\n- CON: Also presents clear structure focusing on cognitive development concerns, engagement effectiveness, and electoral integrity. Well-organized counterarguments. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References National Center for Education Statistics study, cites Scotland and Austria as examples, mentions civic education classes. Provides specific support for claims. Score: 4\n- CON: Cites \"Developmental Psychology\" journal, references research on cognitive maturity and peer influence, uses Austria/Scotland data differently. Strong evidentiary support. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's cognitive development argument, challenges the Austria/Scotland interpretation, addresses populist rhetoric concern by noting it applies to all ages. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Directly refutes PRO's maturity claims, challenges the civic education argument, reframes the Austria/Scotland evidence, maintains focus on cognitive development throughout. Excellent clash. Score: 5\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes benefits of inclusivity, civic engagement, and youth voice on issues affecting them. Some comparative weighing but could be stronger. Score: 3\n- CON: Weighs electoral integrity, informed decision-making, and democratic robustness against potential benefits. Clearer prioritization of why risks outweigh benefits. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's strongest moment is the rebuttal pointing out that concerns about social media/populism apply to all ages, not just 16-year-olds. This is a significant defensive point.\n\nCON's strongest moment is consistently maintaining that cognitive maturity research shows development continues into mid-20s, and distinguishing between making personal decisions versus voting decisions.\n\nThe key clash point is whether 16-year-olds have sufficient maturity. Both sides engage this directly, but CON provides more specific framing about *what kind* of maturity matters (impulse control, long-term planning) versus PRO's broader claims about existing responsibilities.\n\nOn the Austria/Scotland evidence, both sides use it but CON more effectively challenges whether engagement equals informed participation.\n\nCON's weighing is clearer - they explicitly state \"risks outweigh benefits\" and prioritize electoral integrity. PRO focuses more on benefits without as much comparative analysis.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nCON edges ahead primarily on clash/refutation (more sustained engagement with core arguments) and weighing (clearer comparative framework). The debate is close on argument quality and evidence, with both sides performing well. The deciding factor is CON's more effective framing of what's at stake (electoral integrity vs. inclusivity) and more direct engagement with PRO's specific claims.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 5\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior clash and weighing. While both sides presented strong evidence, CON more effectively engaged PRO's specific claims about maturity and reframed the Austria/Scotland evidence. CON's clearer comparative weighing of electoral integrity versus inclusivity, combined with sustained focus on cognitive development distinctions, provided the decisive edge in an otherwise closely contested debate.\"\n}\n```",
