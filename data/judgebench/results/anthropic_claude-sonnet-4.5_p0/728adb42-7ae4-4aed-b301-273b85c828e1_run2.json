  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (inclusivity, cognitive development, global economy) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents three clear counter-contentions (logistical/financial burdens, quality dilution, local control). Well-structured and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific statistics (21% non-English speakers), references American Council on Teaching of Foreign Languages, New American Economy study, Center for Applied Linguistics. Provides concrete examples (San Francisco, Miami programs). Score: 4\n- CON: References National Center for Education Statistics, mentions 350+ languages statistic, but relies more on logical reasoning than cited studies. Less specific evidence than PRO. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's logistical concerns with dual-language immersion examples, responds to quality dilution with research, addresses local control. Score: 4\n- CON: Effectively challenges PRO's \"most prevalent languages\" solution, distinguishes voluntary vs. mandatory programs, questions the applicability of PRO's research. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Frames as \"investment in future,\" mentions long-term benefits, but limited comparative weighing of why benefits outweigh costs. Score: 3\n- CON: Explicitly weighs \"practicality versus idealism,\" argues mandatory system would \"hinder\" rather than help, compares voluntary well-resourced programs to mandatory underfunded ones. More direct comparative weighing. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- CON's central argument about the distinction between voluntary/well-resourced programs (which PRO's evidence supports) versus mandatory/potentially underfunded programs is a critical point that PRO doesn't fully resolve\n- PRO's evidence is stronger, but CON effectively questions its applicability to a mandatory system\n- CON's teacher shortage argument (citing existing shortages even for common languages) is a concrete harm that PRO doesn't adequately address beyond suggesting \"targeted training\"\n- The 350+ languages point creates a real feasibility concern that PRO's \"focus on prevalent languages\" doesn't fully answer\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nKey decision points:\n1. CON successfully distinguishes between existing successful programs and a mandatory system\n2. PRO has better evidence quality but CON questions its relevance effectively\n3. CON's weighing of practical implementation challenges against theoretical benefits is more developed\n4. The teacher shortage argument remains largely unrefuted by PRO\n\nWinner: CON - slightly stronger on weighing and successfully undermines the applicability of PRO's evidence to a mandatory system.\n\nConfidence: 0.65 - Clear but contestable, as PRO had stronger evidence but CON had better comparative weighing.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior impact weighing, effectively distinguishing voluntary well-resourced programs from mandatory underfunded systems. CON's teacher shortage argument and practicality-versus-idealism framework successfully undermined PRO's evidence applicability. While PRO presented stronger evidence, CON's comparative analysis of feasibility challenges outweighed theoretical benefits, particularly the unresolved concern about implementing programs across 350+ languages.\"\n}\n```",
