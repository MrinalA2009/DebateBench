  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate through multiple passes to ensure consistency.\n\n## First Pass Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear position on prohibition, but relies heavily on general environmental concerns. Arguments are coherent but somewhat repetitive. Score: 3\n- CON: Well-structured case linking deep-sea mining to renewable energy transition, addresses regulatory frameworks. More strategic framing. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites NOAA report (90% species loss), European Commission report on recycling. Limited specific evidence. Score: 3\n- CON: References IEA projections (quadrupling mineral demand by 2040), ISA regulatory development, specific minerals (nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese). More concrete grounding. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Engages CON's arguments about technology and regulation, challenges necessity claim. However, doesn't fully address the mineral demand argument. Score: 3\n- CON: Directly refutes PRO's alternative sources claim, challenges the \"false dichotomy\" assertion, addresses recycling limitations. More comprehensive engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes long-term ecosystem preservation and unforeseen consequences. Limited comparative weighing against CON's impacts. Score: 2\n- CON: Explicitly compares deep-sea vs terrestrial mining impacts, weighs climate change as \"far greater environmental threat,\" frames prohibition as hindering decarbonization. Superior comparative analysis. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- CON consistently frames the debate around necessity for renewable energy transition\n- PRO's recycling argument is challenged effectively by CON noting it's \"insufficient\" and \"primary extraction remains essential\"\n- CON's regulatory framework argument (ISA) is dismissed by PRO as \"in its infancy\" but CON counters with \"years of dedicated work\"\n- PRO drops the comparison between terrestrial vs deep-sea mining impacts\n- CON's climate change weighing (prohibition hinders green transition) is not adequately answered by PRO\n\nThe scores remain stable across both passes.\n\n## Final Decision\n\nCON wins through superior impact weighing and more effective clash. CON successfully reframed the debate from simple environmental protection to a choice between mining methods, arguing deep-sea mining enables climate solutions while PRO failed to provide scalable alternatives to meet mineral demand. CON's comparative weighing (climate change as greater threat, terrestrial mining as worse alternative) went largely uncontested.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing, successfully framing deep-sea mining as necessary for renewable energy transition while comparing it favorably to terrestrial alternatives.
