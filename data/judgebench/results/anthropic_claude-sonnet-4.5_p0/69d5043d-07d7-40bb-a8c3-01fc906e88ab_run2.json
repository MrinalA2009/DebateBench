  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n**FIRST PASS EVALUATION:**\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured arguments about biodiversity loss and environmental impacts. Arguments are logically coherent with specific mechanisms (sediment plumes, noise pollution, slow recovery). Score: 4\n- CON: Presents coherent counter-arguments about mineral needs and regulatory frameworks, but less specific on mechanisms. Arguments are clear but somewhat generic. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific 2020 Science Advances study, provides concrete details (recovery timescales of centuries to millennia, endemic species). Score: 4\n- CON: References IEA and World Bank studies but provides less specific detail. Claims about ISA framework lack concrete evidence of effectiveness. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's regulatory argument, challenges the \"false solution\" framing, addresses the ISA framework's inadequacy. Strong rebuttal of \"evolving regulations.\" Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's precautionary principle but dismisses concerns as \"emotional appeals\" without fully addressing the irreversibility argument. Less direct engagement with specific biodiversity claims. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly weighs irreversible biodiversity loss and ecosystem destruction against mineral needs. Emphasizes permanence and magnitude. Explicitly invokes precautionary principle with justification. Score: 4\n- CON: Attempts weighing (benefits vs. risks) but doesn't adequately address the irreversibility argument. Claims benefits \"outweigh\" risks without comparative analysis of magnitude/timeframe. Score: 2\n\n**SECOND PASS VERIFICATION:**\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO consistently emphasizes irreversibility and uses it as a trump card\n- CON's \"phased approach\" doesn't address why we should risk irreversible harm\n- PRO's dropped argument: CON never adequately responds to the centuries-to-millennia recovery timeframe\n- CON's regulatory framework argument is weakened by PRO's point about learning from mistakes being too late\n- PRO's alternative solutions (recycling, circular economy) are mentioned but not deeply challenged by CON\n\nScores remain stable. PRO wins on stronger evidence, better clash, and superior impact weighing.\n\n**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:**\nPRO has a clear advantage in 3/4 categories with meaningful margins. The irreversibility argument is largely uncontested in its severity. Confidence: 0.75 (clear but contestable - CON made reasonable arguments about mineral needs and regulations, but didn't adequately address the core irreversibility concern).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior impact weighing and evidence.
