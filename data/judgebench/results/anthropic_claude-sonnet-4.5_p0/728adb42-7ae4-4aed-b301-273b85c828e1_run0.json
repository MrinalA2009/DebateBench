  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (inclusivity, cognitive development, global economy) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents three clear counter-contentions (logistical/financial burdens, quality dilution, local control). Well-structured and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific statistics (21% non-English speakers), references American Council on Teaching Foreign Languages, New American Economy study, Center for Applied Linguistics. Provides concrete examples (San Francisco, Miami programs). Score: 4\n- CON: References National Center for Education Statistics, mentions 350+ languages statistic, but relies more on logical reasoning than specific studies. Less concrete evidence than PRO. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's logistical concerns with dual-language immersion examples, responds to quality dilution with research, addresses local control. Score: 4\n- CON: Effectively challenges PRO's \"most prevalent languages\" solution, distinguishes voluntary vs. mandatory programs, questions the applicability of PRO's research. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes long-term benefits, frames as \"investment in future,\" but limited comparative weighing of why benefits outweigh costs. Score: 3\n- CON: Explicitly weighs \"practicality versus idealism,\" argues mandatory system would \"hinder\" rather than help, compares voluntary well-resourced programs to mandatory underfunded ones. More direct comparative weighing. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- CON's central argument about the distinction between voluntary/well-resourced programs (which PRO's evidence supports) versus mandatory/potentially underfunded programs is a critical point that PRO doesn't fully resolve\n- PRO's evidence is stronger, but CON effectively questions its applicability to a mandatory system\n- CON's weighing mechanism (practicality vs. idealism) provides clearer comparative framework\n- PRO's rebuttal that \"successful programs exist\" doesn't address CON's point about scaling to a mandatory nationwide system\n\n## Final Determination\n\nCON wins this debate primarily through superior impact weighing and effective clash. While PRO presented stronger evidence, CON successfully reframed the debate around feasibility and questioned whether PRO's evidence from voluntary programs applies to a mandatory system. CON's distinction between well-resourced voluntary programs and a mandatory underfunded system was never fully resolved by PRO. The weighing of \"practicality versus idealism\" gave CON a clearer comparative framework.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing and effective reframing. CON's distinction between voluntary well-resourced programs (which PRO's evidence supports) versus mandatory underfunded systems was never adequately resolved. CON's practicality versus idealism framework provided clearer comparative weighing, while PRO's stronger evidence base couldn't overcome the feasibility concerns about nationwide implementation.\"\n}\n```",
