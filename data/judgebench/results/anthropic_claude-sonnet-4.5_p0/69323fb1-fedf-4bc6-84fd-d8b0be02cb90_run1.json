  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear, structured contentions with specific mechanisms (frequent flyer levy, personal carbon allowance). Arguments are internally consistent and logically developed. Score: 4\n- CON: Raises valid concerns about equity and technology, but arguments are somewhat contradictory (claiming rationing affects low-income while also acknowledging it targets high-frequency flyers). Less structured. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific sources (ICAO projections, Global Environmental Change 2020 study with the 1% statistic), provides concrete data (2.5% of global CO2, doubling/tripling by 2050). Score: 5\n- CON: Makes claims about aviation industry investments and sustainable fuels but provides no specific sources, studies, or data. Mostly assertions. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's equity concerns by explaining the progressive nature of their mechanism, refutes the technology argument with timeline concerns, engages with the modal shift argument. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's arguments but often restates positions rather than directly refuting evidence. Doesn't address the 1% statistic or ICAO projections effectively. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly weighs climate catastrophe against inconvenience, emphasizes urgency and immediacy of action needed, compares magnitude of inaction. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions unintended consequences and social equity but doesn't comparatively weigh these against climate impacts or explain why they outweigh PRO's concerns. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\nPRO's core strength: The 1% statistic creating 50% of emissions is never effectively refuted by CON, making PRO's progressive framing stick. The timeline argument (technologies are \"decades away\") directly undermines CON's technology solution.\n\nCON's weakness: Claims rationing would hurt low-income travelers but never explains how a frequent flyer levy targeting the top 1% would affect infrequent essential travelers. The technology argument lacks specificity and doesn't address the urgency problem.\n\nThe scores remain stable upon review.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins on superior evidence grounding (specific studies vs. assertions), effective clash (directly refuting CON's equity concerns), and clearer impact weighing (immediate action vs. future technology). CON's arguments about technology and equity are not sufficiently developed or supported to overcome PRO's evidence-based case.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 - Clear winner but CON raised legitimate concerns that could have been more competitive with better evidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding, citing specific studies showing 1% of flyers cause 50% of emissions, which CON never effectively refutes.
