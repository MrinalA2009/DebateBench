  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear pillars (future skills, cognitive development, creativity) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents three counter-arguments (curriculum overload, developmental appropriateness, inequality) that are logically structured and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Bureau of Labor Statistics (13% growth projection), University of California study on logical reasoning, references Finland/Singapore systems, mentions ScratchJr as concrete example. Score: 4\n- CON: Makes logical arguments but relies primarily on reasoning rather than cited evidence. No specific studies or data points provided. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses all three CON arguments in rebuttal, provides counterexamples (Finland/Singapore), explains how programming complements rather than replaces subjects. Score: 4\n- CON: Effectively challenges PRO's rebuttals, distinguishes between computational thinking tools and \"formal programming,\" questions the practicality of resource allocation, points out lack of concrete implementation plans. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes future job market preparation, cognitive benefits across disciplines, and bridging digital divide. However, doesn't explicitly compare magnitude/probability of impacts versus CON's concerns. Score: 3\n- CON: Clearly weighs the burden on struggling schools, developmental harm from premature instruction, and practical resource constraints. Explicitly argues their harms outweigh PRO's benefits. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- CON effectively challenges PRO's claim that programming can be integrated without trade-offs\n- CON distinguishes between basic computational thinking (ScratchJr) and formal programming, catching PRO in a potential equivocation\n- PRO provides more concrete evidence but CON provides stronger logical analysis of implementation problems\n- CON's point about \"no concrete plan\" for resource distribution is a significant dropped argument by PRO\n- CON's weighing of practical harms (curriculum overload, inequality exacerbation) is more explicit than PRO's weighing\n\nThe key clash is whether the benefits outweigh implementation costs. CON more effectively argues that PRO's solution creates unaddressed problems, while PRO doesn't adequately respond to the resource allocation critique.\n\n## Final Judgment\n\nCON wins on superior clash and weighing despite PRO's stronger evidence base. CON's distinction between computational thinking tools and formal programming undermines PRO's developmental appropriateness response. CON's unanswered challenge about concrete implementation plans for underfunded schools is decisive.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing and effective refutation.
