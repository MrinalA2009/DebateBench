  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear, structured claims (division, authoritarianism, global cooperation obstruction). Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers counter-framework with three points (unity, democratic foundation, balanced cooperation). Arguments are coherent but somewhat defensive rather than proactive. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific examples (US/UK polarization, Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, COVID-19 pandemic, McCarthyism). Examples are relevant and integrated into arguments. Score: 4\n- CON: References post-WWII US civil rights, European Union as examples. Less specific detail and fewer concrete examples overall. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's examples (addresses post-WWII US by noting McCarthyism, challenges EU example with COVID-19 response). Responds to key claims about nationalism not being inherently authoritarian. Score: 4\n- CON: Acknowledges PRO's points but primarily argues \"it's not inherent to nationalism\" without fully addressing the empirical pattern PRO establishes. Less direct engagement with specific examples. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Consistently emphasizes magnitude (democratic erosion, global crises) and provides comparative framing (short-term vs. long-term). Clear prioritization of impacts. Score: 4\n- CON: Argues for \"balance\" and \"nuance\" but doesn't clearly weigh why potential benefits outweigh demonstrated harms. Limited comparative analysis. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO maintains consistent offensive pressure with concrete examples\n- CON's \"it depends on how it's practiced\" argument concedes that nationalism CAN be destructive, weakening their negation\n- PRO's COVID-19 example directly refutes CON's EU cooperation claim\n- CON never adequately addresses why the pattern of nationalist exploitation should be ignored\n\nScores remain stable.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Check\n\nKey decision points:\n1. CON concedes nationalism can be misused/manipulated - this weakens their position on the resolution\n2. PRO provides more specific, recent examples vs. CON's more general/historical references\n3. PRO's weighing of transnational challenges (climate, pandemics) goes largely uncontested\n4. CON's defensive posture (\"not inherently destructive\") doesn't negate that it IS destructive in modern practice\n\nWinner: PRO\nConfidence: 0.75 (Clear but CON presented reasonable counter-framework)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence and weighing. CON's concession that nationalism can be manipulated undermines their negation. PRO's specific examples (Orb\u00e1n, COVID-19) and impact comparison (transnational challenges) outweigh CON's theoretical framework.
