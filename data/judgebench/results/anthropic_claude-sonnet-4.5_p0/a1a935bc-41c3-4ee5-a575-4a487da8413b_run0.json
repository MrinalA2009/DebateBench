  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear arguments about cultural preservation and national sovereignty with concrete examples (Bali, Bhutan). Arguments are coherent and logically structured. Score: 4\n- CON: Offers well-structured counterarguments about cultural exchange, economic impact, and dynamic culture. Clear logical flow and effective framing. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Uses specific examples (Bali's temple commercialization, Bhutan's policy) with mechanisms explained. Good integration of support. Score: 4\n- CON: Provides reasoning about economic dependence and cultural exchange but relies more on general principles than specific examples. Less concrete grounding. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's arguments about economic harm and cultural exchange. Addresses the \"high-value, low-impact\" criticism and responds to romanticization claims. Score: 4\n- CON: Strongly engages PRO's examples, distinguishing between unmanaged vs. regulated tourism. Directly challenges the \"cultural stagnation\" implication and economic dismissal. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Emphasizes long-term cultural preservation over short-term economic benefits. Frames sustainability and community rights as paramount. Some comparative weighing present. Score: 3\n- CON: Weighs economic lifelines, global understanding, and cultural dynamism against preservation. Makes explicit comparisons about isolation vs. engagement. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate flow:\n- PRO establishes sovereignty and preservation framework with examples\n- CON counters with exchange, economics, and dynamic culture\n- PRO rebuts by distinguishing sustainable vs. exploitative tourism\n- CON responds by clarifying regulated vs. restricted tourism\n- Both sides maintain consistent positions through summaries\n\nKey comparative factors:\n1. CON more effectively distinguishes their position (regulated tourism) from what they oppose (unregulated tourism)\n2. PRO provides stronger concrete evidence (Bali, Bhutan examples)\n3. CON's economic impact argument remains largely unrefuted in terms of immediate community needs\n4. PRO's sustainability argument is compelling but CON challenges whether restriction is the only solution\n\nThe critical clash point: CON argues for regulation over restriction, while PRO argues restriction IS the regulation. CON's framing that PRO advocates \"isolation\" vs. their \"responsible engagement\" is more nuanced and addresses PRO's concerns while avoiding the harms PRO identifies.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nCON edges ahead by:\n1. Better distinguishing their advocacy (regulated tourism) from the harms PRO identifies (unmanaged tourism)\n2. More effective weighing of multiple impact dimensions\n3. Successfully challenging PRO's binary framing\n4. Addressing economic realities that PRO somewhat dismisses\n\nThis is a close debate where both sides performed well, but CON's comparative weighing and clearer alternative solution gives them the edge.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by effectively distinguishing regulated tourism from unmanaged tourism, providing superior impact weighing across economic, cultural exchange, and dynamism dimensions.
