  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear framework (moral, economic, social implications), structured arguments about government mandates. Arguments are coherent but somewhat general. Score: 3\n- CON: Provides specific counterframework (efficacy and unintended consequences), challenges PRO's statistical foundation with nuanced analysis. More sophisticated argumentation. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites US Census Bureau (82 cents), AAUW study (7% gap), Equal Pay Act, Lilly Ledbetter Act. Evidence is relevant but limited depth. Score: 3\n- CON: Cites Glassdoor study (4.9% adjusted gap), provides specific methodology critique, explains variables controlled. More rigorous evidentiary engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Responds to CON's statistical critique but doesn't fully engage with the \"adjusted vs. unadjusted\" distinction. Addresses unintended consequences claim but superficially. Score: 3\n- CON: Directly engages PRO's 82-cent statistic, distinguishes between overt discrimination laws and broader mandates, challenges AAUW methodology. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Mentions economic growth, poverty reduction, gender equality but doesn't comparatively weigh against CON's concerns about job losses and business impact. Score: 2\n- CON: Weighs innovation, flexibility, job losses against PRO's equity claims. Distinguishes between different types of discrimination and their solutions. Score: 4\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- CON consistently challenges the foundational premise (82 cents vs. 4.9% adjusted)\n- PRO never adequately responds to the adjusted gap argument\n- CON's framework of \"efficacy and unintended consequences\" is applied throughout\n- PRO's evidence of past legislation success isn't weighed against CON's distinction between overt discrimination laws and broader mandates\n- CON provides more comparative analysis (market solutions vs. mandates)\n\nScores remain stable.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Check\n\nKey debate moments:\n1. CON's adjusted gap argument (4.9%) vs. PRO's unadjusted (82 cents/18%) - PRO never reconciles this\n2. CON distinguishes overt discrimination laws from broad mandates - PRO treats them as equivalent\n3. Unintended consequences - PRO dismisses without evidence, CON provides mechanism\n4. Market solutions - PRO calls insufficient but doesn't weigh why mandates are superior\n\nWinner: CON wins on superior clash, evidence quality, and comparative weighing. PRO's failure to address the adjusted vs. unadjusted gap distinction is critical.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 (Clear winner, though PRO had legitimate points about systemic barriers that weren't fully refuted)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior evidence engagement and comparative weighing.
