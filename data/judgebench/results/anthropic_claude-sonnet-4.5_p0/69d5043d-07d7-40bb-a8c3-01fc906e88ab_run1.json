  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with two main contentions (biodiversity destruction, environmental impacts). Arguments are logically coherent and internally consistent. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents counter-arguments about mineral needs and evolving regulations, but less developed mechanistically. Some tension between \"regulations are evolving\" and \"can be strengthened.\" Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific 2020 Science Advances study, provides mechanisms (sediment plumes, noise pollution, recovery timescales). Well-integrated support. Score: 4\n- CON: References IEA and World Bank studies but less specific. Claims about \"more environmentally friendly\" mining lack detailed support. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's regulation argument, challenges the \"false solution\" framing, addresses the IEA citation specifically. Strong rebuttal of \"evolving regulations.\" Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with precautionary principle and land-based mining comparison, but dismisses PRO's concerns as \"emotional appeals\" without fully addressing the irreversibility argument. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clearly prioritizes irreversible biodiversity loss and ecosystem destruction over mineral extraction. Uses timeframe (millennia recovery) and magnitude (planetary health) effectively. Score: 4\n- CON: Argues benefits outweigh risks but doesn't comparatively weigh against irreversibility. Less developed impact calculus. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n- PRO consistently hammers irreversibility and precautionary principle\n- CON's strongest point (mineral necessity) is countered by PRO's recycling/circular economy alternative\n- CON never adequately addresses the \"millennia recovery\" timeframe argument\n- PRO's dropped argument: the irreversibility of extinction and habitat destruction\n- CON's claim that regulations can mitigate risks is challenged but not proven effective for slow-growing ecosystems\n\nScores remain stable across both passes.\n\n## Final Determination\n\nPRO wins through superior impact weighing and more effective clash. The irreversibility argument (species recovering over millennia, if at all) was never adequately answered by CON. While CON raised legitimate points about mineral needs, PRO provided alternatives (recycling, circular economy) and successfully argued that uncertain future regulations cannot justify irreversible present harm.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on superior impact weighing and clash.
