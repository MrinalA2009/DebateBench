  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure with two contentions, specific mechanisms (frequent flyer levy, personal carbon allowance), logical flow. Score: 4\n- CON: Three main arguments but less specific on alternatives, some internal tension between claiming rationing affects essential travelers while also saying industry solutions exist. Score: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites specific statistics (2.5% of global CO2, ICAO projections, 1% causing 50% of emissions from Global Environmental Change 2020), concrete mechanisms. Score: 4\n- CON: References sustainable aviation fuels and technologies but provides no specific data, percentages, or sources. Claims \"up to 80%\" reduction but unsupported. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's equity concern by explaining the progressive nature of their levy, refutes technology argument with timeline concerns, responds to modal shift argument. Score: 4\n- CON: Engages with PRO's arguments but responses are more assertion-based (\"inevitably affect,\" \"misleading\") without substantive counter-evidence. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs climate catastrophe against inconvenience, emphasizes urgency and immediacy of action needed, compares magnitude of inaction. Score: 4\n- CON: Mentions social equity and economic viability but doesn't comparatively weigh these against climate impacts or explain why they outweigh PRO's concerns. Score: 2\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nRe-examining key clash points:\n\n1. **Equity argument**: PRO provides specific evidence (1% causing 50%) that their mechanism is progressive. CON asserts it would affect essential travelers but doesn't refute PRO's targeting mechanism with evidence.\n\n2. **Technology timeline**: PRO argues technologies are \"decades away\" and insufficient. CON claims \"significant strides\" but provides no timeline or evidence these will meet the 2050 crisis PRO establishes.\n\n3. **Effectiveness**: PRO shows ICAO projections of doubling/tripling emissions. CON doesn't provide counter-projections or evidence that industry solutions alone will prevent this.\n\nScores remain consistent on second pass.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking for any dropped arguments:\n- CON's modal shift argument (shift to cars/buses) - PRO addresses this as \"speculative\" and notes aviation's unique carbon intensity\n- PRO's 2.5% current emissions growing to double/triple - CON never disputes these numbers\n- CON's connectivity/economic growth concerns - PRO weighs this against climate catastrophe\n\nWinner determination: PRO wins on superior evidence grounding, more effective clash, and clearer impact weighing. While CON raises legitimate concerns about equity and technology, they fail to substantiate these with evidence comparable to PRO's cited studies and projections.\n\nConfidence: 0.75 - Clear winner but CON raised some valid conceptual points that weren't completely unreasonable, just under-supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding, citing specific studies and projections that CON never effectively refuted.
