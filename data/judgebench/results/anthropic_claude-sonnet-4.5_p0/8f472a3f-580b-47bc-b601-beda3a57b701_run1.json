  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear thesis that nationalism creates \"us vs them\" mentality. Structured arguments about erosion of cooperation, social tensions, and xenophobia. Consistent framing throughout. Score: 4\n- CON: Clear counter-thesis about responsible nationalism. Three main points (identity/belonging, democratic governance, global cooperation compatibility). Well-organized. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References WWI/WWII, \"America First,\" Brexit, hate crimes. Uses historical examples but somewhat general. Score: 3\n- CON: Cites Canada's multiculturalism, voter turnout correlations, climate cooperation examples. Comparable specificity to PRO. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's unity argument, challenges civic engagement claim, refutes coexistence with cooperation thesis. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n- CON: Addresses \"us vs them\" claim with Canada example, counters democratic undermining with civic engagement evidence, responds to cooperation conflict. Effective engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Explicitly weighs in summary - \"negative consequences far outweigh benefits,\" discusses magnitude (marginalization, erosion of cooperation), addresses timeframe (historical to contemporary). Clear comparative weighing. Score: 4\n- CON: States constructive aspects \"outweigh negative consequences\" but less developed comparative analysis. Mentions benefits but limited explicit weighing framework. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass Verification\n\nReviewing key clash points:\n1. **Marginalization claim**: PRO asserts nationalism marginalizes minorities; CON counters with Canada example showing inclusive nationalism possible. CON provides concrete counter-example.\n2. **Democratic governance**: PRO claims nationalism undermines democracy; CON provides civic engagement evidence. Neither fully resolves this clash.\n3. **Global cooperation**: PRO argues incompatibility (climate crisis example); CON argues coexistence possible. PRO's climate example is more concrete.\n\nCritical observation: PRO makes stronger comparative weighing in final speech, explicitly stating impacts \"far outweigh\" and providing framework. CON's weighing statement is present but less developed.\n\n## Third Pass - Final Verification\n\nChecking for dropped arguments:\n- CON's Canada multiculturalism example not fully addressed by PRO\n- PRO's climate crisis/collective action point not fully refuted by CON\n- Both sides maintain consistent positions throughout\n\nWinner determination: This is close. Both sides scored similarly on quality, evidence, and clash. The differentiator is weighing - PRO provided more explicit comparative impact analysis in the summary, explaining why negative consequences outweigh benefits with specific reference to marginalization and global cooperation erosion. CON stated their impacts outweigh but with less comparative framework.\n\nConfidence: 0.65 - Clear winner but contestable given strong performance by both sides.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on superior impact weighing.
