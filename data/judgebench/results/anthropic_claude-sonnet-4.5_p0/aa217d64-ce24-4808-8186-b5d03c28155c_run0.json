  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then perform consistency checks.\n\n## First Pass Evaluation\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear framework (restorative justice), logical progression, coherent claims about victim involvement benefits. Well-structured throughout. Score: 4\n- CON: Clear counter-framework emphasizing objectivity/impartiality, logical concerns about bias and inconsistency. Well-organized arguments. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References \"studies\" showing victim satisfaction and closure, mentions empirical evidence for reduced recidivism, cites existing victim impact statements. Moderate specificity. Score: 3\n- CON: Relies more on logical reasoning and principles than empirical evidence. Arguments about bias and emotional influence are reasoned but lack specific examples or data. Score: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's consistency concerns, refutes \"innocent until proven guilty\" argument by noting sentencing occurs post-conviction, engages with objectivity concerns. Score: 4\n- CON: Directly challenges PRO's structured programs claim, rebuts the \"innocent until proven guilty\" response, engages with restorative justice claims. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Weighs victim satisfaction, healing, reduced recidivism, and societal safety. Explicitly compares benefits vs. drawbacks in summary. Clear comparative analysis. Score: 4\n- CON: Weighs fairness, objectivity, and systemic integrity. Argues these foundational principles outweigh individual satisfaction. Some comparative weighing but less developed than PRO. Score: 3\n\n## Second Pass (Consistency Check)\n\nReviewing the debate again:\n\n**Argument Quality:** Both sides maintain coherent positions throughout. No change needed. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:** PRO does reference studies and empirical evidence, while CON relies primarily on principled reasoning. PRO has slight edge. PRO: 3, CON: 2\n\n**Clash & Refutation:** Both engage effectively. PRO addresses specific CON concerns about timing and structure. CON challenges PRO's empirical claims. Equal engagement. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:** PRO explicitly weighs multiple impacts and makes comparative claims (\"benefits far outweigh drawbacks\"). CON weighs principles but less explicitly compares magnitude. PRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n## Winner Determination\n\nPRO has slight advantages in evidence grounding (3 vs 2) and impact weighing (4 vs 3). Both sides are equal on argument quality and clash. PRO's explicit comparative weighing in the summary (\"benefits far outweigh the potential drawbacks\") and reference to empirical support gives them the edge in a close debate.\n\nConfidence: 0.65 - Clear but contestable, as CON presented strong principled arguments about systemic integrity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on superior evidence grounding and impact weighing. While both sides clashed effectively and presented coherent arguments, PRO's references to empirical studies on victim satisfaction and recidivism, combined with explicit comparative weighing of benefits versus drawbacks, provided stronger justification for their position than CON's primarily principle-based reasoning.\"\n}\n```",
