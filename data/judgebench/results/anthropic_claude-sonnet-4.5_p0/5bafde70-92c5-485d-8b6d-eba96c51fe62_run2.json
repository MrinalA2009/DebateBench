  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then verify my judgment through consistency passes.\n\n**FIRST PASS EVALUATION:**\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents three clear contentions (fairness, economic stability, service quality) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n- CON: Also presents three clear contentions (worker autonomy, consumer choice, economic viability) with good structure. Arguments are logical and well-developed. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References Economic Policy Institute and general research on bias in tipping. Some claims about customer willingness to pay higher prices lack specific support. Score: 3\n- CON: Cites specific Cornell University 2019 study. Makes concrete claims about earning potential but some assertions about business impacts lack detailed support. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses CON's points about earning potential and accountability. Responds to the Cornell study by noting it doesn't account for bias. Engages with economic burden argument. Score: 4\n- CON: Directly challenges PRO's bias argument, questions mechanism for eliminating bias, refutes service quality claims, and challenges economic assumptions. Strong engagement throughout. Score: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Attempts to weigh fairness and stability benefits. Claims customers willing to pay more but doesn't clearly compare magnitude of impacts. Limited comparative analysis. Score: 3\n- CON: Points out that removing tipping creates \"far greater problems,\" emphasizes immediate harm to workers and businesses, but could develop comparative weighing more. Score: 3\n\n**SECOND PASS VERIFICATION:**\n\nRe-examining the debate:\n- Both sides maintain consistent quality throughout\n- CON's challenge that \"changing payment structure won't eradicate bias\" is a strong logical point that PRO doesn't fully answer\n- PRO's argument about systemic bias affecting marginalized workers is compelling but doesn't fully address CON's merit-based earning point\n- CON effectively questions PRO's mechanisms and assumptions\n- The clash is relatively even, with both sides engaging substantively\n\n**THIRD PASS - FINAL DETERMINATION:**\n\nThe debate is very close. Key deciding factors:\n1. CON more effectively challenges PRO's causal mechanisms (how will flat wages eliminate bias?)\n2. PRO's claim about customer willingness to pay is less supported than CON's specific Cornell study\n3. CON's point about removing worker autonomy and capping high earners is not fully refuted by PRO\n4. Both sides engage well, but CON slightly edges in questioning the logical foundations of PRO's case\n\nWinner: CON by a narrow margin\nConfidence: 0.55 (very close debate)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.55,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins narrowly by effectively challenging PRO's causal mechanisms, particularly questioning how flat wages would eliminate bias while removing merit-based earning potential.
