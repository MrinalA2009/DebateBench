  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents three clear contentions: common heritage preservation, conflict prevention, and scientific advancement promotion. Arguments are logically structured and internally consistent, citing the Outer Space Treaty as foundational support.\n\nCON presents three contentions: investment/innovation incentives, resource security, and facilitating human expansion. Arguments are coherent and well-developed, with clear causal chains linking ownership to desired outcomes.\n\nBoth sides maintain logical consistency throughout. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING:**\n\nPRO cites the Outer Space Treaty (1967, 100+ nations) and the International Space Station as concrete examples. However, relies heavily on historical analogies without specific mechanisms for how ownership leads to conflict in space.\n\nCON provides reasoning about capital-intensive nature of space exploration and resource scarcity on Earth. Uses ISS as counter-example (government-funded vs. self-sustaining model). Lacks specific citations but provides stronger mechanistic reasoning about economic incentives.\n\nPRO: 3, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION:**\n\nPRO directly engages CON's investment argument, arguing it leads to exploitation. Addresses resource security by claiming it creates geopolitical tensions. Counters expansion argument with ISS example.\n\nCON directly refutes monopolization concerns by clarifying they advocate regulated ownership. Addresses conflict prevention by proposing international legal frameworks. Distinguishes between ISS (government project) and sustainable economic models. CON more effectively dismantles opponent's framework by showing OST has led to \"stagnation.\"\n\nPRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING:**\n\nPRO emphasizes preventing inequality and conflict, arguing these outweigh economic benefits. However, doesn't clearly compare magnitude or probability of impacts.\n\nCON explicitly weighs: frames choice as \"stagnation vs. innovation,\" argues resource depletion is existential (\"long-term survival\"), and positions multi-planetary expansion as critical for species survival. More direct comparative weighing of \"well-intentioned but ineffective\" vs. \"innovation and expansion.\"\n\nPRO: 2, CON: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nCON wins on superior clash and weighing. CON more effectively dismantled PRO's framework by arguing the OST has failed to produce results, while PRO's conflict concerns were adequately addressed through proposed legal frameworks. CON's weighing of existential resource concerns and species survival against PRO's conflict prevention was more explicit and compelling. PRO's reliance on the ISS example was effectively turned by CON distinguishing government projects from sustainable economic models.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing and clash.
