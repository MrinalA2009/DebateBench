  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\nPRO presents clear arguments centered on restorative justice principles, victim closure, and holistic justice. The structure is logical and internally consistent throughout.\nCON presents equally clear arguments about consistency, objectivity, and systemic integrity. Both sides maintain coherent positions.\nPRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\nPRO references empirical studies showing victim satisfaction and closure, mentions victim impact statements as existing tools, and cites reduced recidivism in restorative justice programs.\nCON relies more on logical reasoning about potential consequences (bias, inconsistency) but provides less concrete evidence. Arguments are more theoretical about what \"could\" happen.\nPRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\nPRO directly addresses CON's concerns about consistency (structured programs), \"innocent until proven guilty\" (sentencing occurs post-conviction), and rehabilitation effectiveness.\nCON engages with PRO's points about structured programs and restorative justice, arguing emotional influence persists despite guidelines. Both sides engage substantively.\nPRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\nPRO explicitly weighs impacts in summary: victim satisfaction, reduced recidivism, healing vs. punishment, and \"benefits far outweigh drawbacks.\"\nCON emphasizes systemic integrity and fairness but provides less comparative weighing of why these outweigh PRO's benefits. CON focuses more on defending principles than comparing magnitude of impacts.\nPRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION**\nPRO wins on two key factors: (1) stronger evidence grounding with empirical support for claims, and (2) more explicit comparative weighing of impacts. PRO effectively neutralizes CON's main objection (inconsistency) by pointing to existing structured programs, while CON's response that judges remain susceptible to emotion is more speculative. PRO's framework of post-conviction involvement also successfully deflects the \"innocent until proven guilty\" concern. CON's arguments about systemic integrity are important but less concretely supported and weighed against PRO's demonstrated benefits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding and comparative impact weighing.
