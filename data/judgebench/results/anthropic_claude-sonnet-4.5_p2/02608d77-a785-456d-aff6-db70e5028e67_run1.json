  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**Argument Quality Analysis:**\nPRO presents clear, structured arguments about criminal impunity and equality before law. The logic flows coherently from premise to conclusion. CON counters with the Vienna Convention framework and existing mechanisms, though the argument about complexity of distinguishing official/non-official acts is somewhat underdeveloped. Both sides maintain internal consistency.\n\nPRO: 4 (Clear and well-structured)\nCON: 4 (Clear and coherent)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding Analysis:**\nPRO cites specific evidence (BBC report of 5,000+ crimes in UK over 5 years with virtually no prosecutions), which is concrete and relevant. This is repeatedly referenced to support claims. CON relies more on theoretical frameworks (Vienna Convention, sending state jurisdiction) but provides no counter-evidence to PRO's statistics or examples of successful prosecutions by sending states. CON's claims about rarity and existing mechanisms working are largely unsupported assertions.\n\nPRO: 4 (Strong, specific evidence)\nCON: 3 (Framework-based but limited concrete support)\n\n**Clash & Refutation Analysis:**\nPRO directly engages CON's main arguments about sending state jurisdiction and expulsion, explaining why these are insufficient (reactive not preventative, rare prosecution). PRO addresses the retaliation concern by clarifying the limited scope of their proposal. CON engages with PRO's evidence but doesn't effectively refute the core statistic about 5,000 crimes - instead dismissing them as \"rare\" without comparative data. CON's claim that these instances are \"extremely rare\" contradicts PRO's evidence without substantiation.\n\nPRO: 4 (Direct, effective engagement)\nCON: 3 (Some engagement but incomplete responses)\n\n**Impact Weighing Analysis:**\nPRO explicitly weighs justice for victims and trust in international relations against diplomatic functionality, arguing their proposal preserves the latter while ensuring the former. PRO frames the debate as balancing outdated immunity against equality before law. CON argues about stability and precedent but doesn't comparatively weigh why avoiding potential political exploitation outweighs actual documented crimes going unpunished. CON's weighing is more implicit than explicit.\n\nPRO: 4 (Clear comparative weighing)\nCON: 3 (Some weighing but less developed)\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nPRO wins on evidence (concrete statistics vs. theoretical assertions), clash (directly refutes key CON arguments), and weighing (clearer comparative analysis). While CON presents coherent arguments about diplomatic functionality, they fail to adequately address PRO's central evidence about thousands of unprosecuted crimes or explain why theoretical mechanisms matter more than documented failures. PRO's distinction between limiting immunity for serious non-official acts while preserving it for official duties effectively answers CON's concerns about diplomatic functionality.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence and weighing.
