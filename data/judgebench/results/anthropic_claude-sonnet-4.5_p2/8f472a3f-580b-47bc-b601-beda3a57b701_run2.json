  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\nPRO: Presents clear arguments about nationalism creating \"us vs them\" mentality, eroding cooperation, and marginalizing minorities. Structure is coherent throughout. Score: 4\nCON: Offers clear counter-arguments about identity, civic engagement, and coexistence with cooperation. Well-organized and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\nPRO: References historical examples (WWI, WWII), contemporary cases (America First, Brexit), and hate crime increases. Provides concrete policy examples. Score: 4\nCON: Cites Canada's multiculturalism as evidence, references voter turnout and civic engagement patterns, but provides less specific grounding than PRO. Score: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\nPRO: Directly engages CON's unity argument, challenges the civic engagement claim, and refutes the coexistence thesis with climate crisis example. Strong engagement. Score: 4\nCON: Responds to marginalization claims with Canada example, addresses democratic governance concerns, but less directly engages PRO's historical evidence and specific policy examples. Score: 3\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\nPRO: Explicitly weighs impacts in summary, argues negative consequences \"far outweigh\" benefits, frames opposition examples as \"exceptions rather than the rule,\" and emphasizes global cooperation erosion. Score: 4\nCON: Claims constructive aspects \"outweigh\" negatives in final summary, but provides less comparative analysis of magnitude and scope. Weighing appears more in conclusion than throughout. Score: 3\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION**\nPRO maintains stronger evidence grounding with specific historical and contemporary examples, engages more directly with opponent's arguments, and provides clearer comparative weighing throughout. CON presents coherent arguments but relies more on theoretical possibilities than concrete evidence, and weighing comes primarily at the end rather than comparatively throughout the debate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding with specific historical and contemporary examples, more direct engagement with opponent's claims, and clearer comparative impact weighing throughout the debate. While CON presented coherent arguments about nationalism's potential benefits, they relied more on theoretical possibilities than concrete evidence and provided less robust clash with PRO's specific examples.\"\n}\n```",
