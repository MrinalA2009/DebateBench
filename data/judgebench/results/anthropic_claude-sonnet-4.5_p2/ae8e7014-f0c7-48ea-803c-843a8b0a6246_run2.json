  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents a clear three-pronged case: climate urgency (2.5% of emissions, tripling by 2050), implementation through carbon pricing, and equity concerns. Arguments are logically structured and internally consistent.\n\nCON counters with economic harm, inequity of rationing, and technological alternatives. The structure is coherent, though there's some tension between claiming carbon pricing is regressive while also advocating market-based innovation.\n\nBoth sides maintain logical consistency throughout. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING:**\n\nPRO provides specific data (2.5% of emissions, tripling by 2050) and mechanisms (carbon pricing, revenue reinvestment). However, lacks detailed support for implementation feasibility.\n\nCON references concrete examples (Airbus hydrogen aircraft, SAF production) and comparative sector analysis. Provides more specific technological grounding but lacks quantification of economic impacts claimed.\n\nPRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION:**\n\nPRO directly engages CON's economic arguments by comparing long-term climate costs to short-term economic impacts. Addresses the equity critique and technological timeline concerns. However, doesn't fully respond to the \"small percentage of emissions\" argument.\n\nCON systematically refutes PRO's equity claims, challenges the urgency framing, and directly contests the carbon pricing mechanism. Engages with PRO's technological dismissal effectively. More comprehensive engagement with opponent's case.\n\nPRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING:**\n\nPRO emphasizes urgency and long-term climate costs versus short-term economic concerns. Attempts comparative weighing but doesn't quantify or deeply compare magnitudes.\n\nCON provides clearer comparative analysis: \"maximum economic pain for minimal environmental gain,\" contrasts aviation's small emission percentage with other sectors, and weighs immediate economic devastation against climate benefits. More explicit prioritization of impacts.\n\nPRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nCON wins on three of four criteria (Evidence, Clash, Weighing) while tying on Argument Quality. CON's comparative weighing was notably stronger, explicitly arguing that rationing creates disproportionate harm relative to benefit. CON also more effectively challenged PRO's equity framing by showing how carbon pricing would be regressive. PRO's failure to adequately respond to the \"small percentage of emissions\" argument and the technological progress examples weakened their case for urgency over innovation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior comparative weighing, demonstrating rationing creates disproportionate economic harm for minimal emission reduction given aviation's small percentage of global emissions.
