  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents a clear thesis that nationalism creates \"us versus them\" mentality leading to erosion of cooperation, social tensions, and xenophobic policies. Arguments are logically structured and internally consistent throughout.\n\nCON argues nationalism provides identity/belonging, enhances democratic governance, and can coexist with global cooperation. The arguments are coherent but somewhat less developed in their logical connections.\n\nPRO: 4/5 - Clear, well-structured arguments with consistent logic\nCON: 4/5 - Clear arguments, though slightly less developed mechanistically\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING:**\n\nPRO cites historical examples (WWI, WWII), contemporary cases (US \"America First,\" Brexit, India), and specific outcomes (hate crimes, climate crisis inaction). Evidence is integrated to support claims.\n\nCON provides examples (Canada's multiculturalism, crisis response, climate cooperation) but with less specificity. The Canada example is mentioned but not deeply developed with supporting details.\n\nPRO: 4/5 - Multiple specific examples with clear connections to claims\nCON: 3/5 - Some examples provided but less detailed and specific\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION:**\n\nPRO directly engages CON's unity argument, challenges the crisis example as misleading, refutes the democratic governance claim, and contests the coexistence with cooperation argument. Each major CON point is addressed.\n\nCON responds to the \"us versus them\" claim with the Canada counterexample, addresses the marginalization concern, defends democratic engagement, and rebuts the cooperation conflict. However, CON doesn't fully engage with PRO's historical evidence or climate crisis example.\n\nPRO: 4/5 - Direct engagement with all major opposing arguments\nCON: 3/5 - Addresses main points but leaves some PRO evidence uncontested\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING:**\n\nPRO explicitly weighs impacts in summary: \"negative consequences far outweigh any potential benefits,\" addresses magnitude (historical wars, contemporary marginalization), and argues CON's examples are \"exceptions rather than the rule.\"\n\nCON attempts weighing in summary: \"constructive aspects...outweigh the negative consequences,\" but provides less comparative analysis of why their impacts matter more or are more probable.\n\nPRO: 4/5 - Clear comparative weighing with magnitude considerations\nCON: 3/5 - Some weighing but less developed comparatively\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**\n\nPRO maintains stronger evidence grounding, more effective clash, and clearer impact weighing. While CON presents coherent arguments about nationalism's potential benefits, they don't adequately address PRO's historical evidence or provide sufficient comparative weighing to overcome PRO's case about destructive consequences. PRO's argument that CON's examples are exceptions is not effectively refuted.\n\nThe debate is relatively close on argument quality, but PRO's advantages in evidence, clash, and weighing are decisive.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding, more effective clash with opponent's arguments, and clearer comparative impact weighing. While CON presented coherent counterarguments about nationalism's potential benefits, they failed to adequately address PRO's historical evidence or refute the claim that positive examples are exceptions. PRO's weighing that destructive consequences outweigh benefits was more developed and persuasive.\"\n}\n```",
