  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\n\nPRO: Presents a clear position that diplomatic immunity should be limited to promote justice and accountability. Arguments are coherent but somewhat repetitive across speeches. The distinction between \"official acts\" and \"personal actions\" is introduced but not fully developed with specific mechanisms. Score: 3\n\nCON: Offers well-structured arguments about the necessity of diplomatic immunity for international relations, the Vienna Convention's importance, and existing accountability mechanisms. Arguments are logically consistent and clearly articulated throughout. Score: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\n\nPRO: Makes general claims about abuses (human trafficking, assault, espionage) but provides no specific examples, data, or mechanisms. Relies heavily on assertions that \"most diplomats already operate within a framework of respect\" without support. Score: 2\n\nCON: References the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as a concrete legal framework, explains specific existing mechanisms (waivers, persona non grata), and provides logical reasoning about reciprocity in international relations. Better grounded in legal and practical frameworks. Score: 4\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\n\nPRO: Engages with CON's Vienna Convention argument by calling it \"outdated\" and addresses the retaliation concern by claiming it's \"unfounded.\" However, responses are often dismissive rather than substantive. Score: 3\n\nCON: Directly addresses PRO's distinction between official/personal acts, explaining why it's \"unworkable\" and would lead to \"subjective interpretation.\" Effectively challenges PRO's characterization of the Vienna Convention and the retaliation argument. More thorough engagement. Score: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\n\nPRO: Claims impacts of accountability \"far outweigh the potential risks\" but doesn't explain magnitude, probability, or timeframe comparatively. Asserts trust-building benefits without comparative analysis. Score: 2\n\nCON: Explicitly weighs \"speculative promise of increased accountability against the very real and immediate threat of destabilized international relations.\" Explains the immediacy and certainty of disruption versus uncertain benefits. Clear comparative weighing. Score: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION**\n\nCON wins across all four categories with stronger argument structure, better grounding in legal frameworks, more effective clash, and superior impact weighing. CON's arguments about the Vienna Convention's continued relevance and the dangers of subjective interpretation of \"official vs. personal\" acts were largely unrefuted by PRO. Most critically, CON provided clear comparative weighing between certain harms and speculative benefits, while PRO failed to demonstrate why their impacts outweigh CON's concerns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins decisively through superior evidence grounding (Vienna Convention, existing mechanisms), effective refutation of PRO's official/personal distinction as unworkable, and clear comparative weighing of certain diplomatic disruption against speculative accountability benefits.
