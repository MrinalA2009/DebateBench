  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**Argument Quality Analysis:**\nPRO presents clear, structured arguments about criminal impunity and equality before law. The logic flows coherently from premise to conclusion. CON counters with the Vienna Convention framework and existing mechanisms, though the argument about complexity of distinguishing official/non-official acts is somewhat underdeveloped. Both sides maintain internal consistency.\n\nPRO: 4 (Clear and well-structured)\nCON: 4 (Clear framework, slightly less developed on some points)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding Analysis:**\nPRO cites specific evidence (BBC report of 5,000+ crimes in UK over 5 years with virtually no prosecutions), which is concrete and relevant. CON acknowledges this evidence but counters that these instances are \"extremely rare\" without providing comparative data. CON relies more on theoretical mechanisms (sending state jurisdiction, persona non grata) without evidence these work effectively in practice.\n\nPRO: 4 (Specific, relevant evidence integrated well)\nCON: 3 (Some support but more theoretical than empirical)\n\n**Clash & Refutation Analysis:**\nPRO directly engages CON's main arguments about sending state jurisdiction and expulsion, calling them \"reactive not preventative\" and pointing to the BBC data as refutation. CON responds to PRO's evidence by calling instances \"extremely rare\" and argues about precedent-setting dangers. Both sides engage, but PRO's refutation is more direct and evidence-based.\n\nPRO: 4 (Direct engagement with opponent's key claims)\nCON: 3 (Engages but less directly addresses the empirical evidence)\n\n**Impact Weighing Analysis:**\nPRO explicitly weighs: argues that accountability builds trust and cooperation, while impunity erodes it. Frames the debate as \"justice vs. outdated interpretation.\" CON weighs stability of international relations and warns of \"dangerous precedent\" and \"political leverage.\" However, CON doesn't directly compare why stability outweighs the 5,000+ crimes PRO cites. PRO provides clearer comparative weighing by arguing their proposal enhances rather than undermines cooperation.\n\nPRO: 4 (Clear comparative weighing of impacts)\nCON: 3 (Some weighing but less comparative analysis)\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nPRO wins on balance. While both sides present coherent arguments, PRO's use of concrete evidence (5,000+ crimes with no prosecutions) that CON never effectively refutes is decisive. CON's theoretical mechanisms (sending state prosecution, expulsion) are undermined by PRO's empirical showing these don't work in practice. PRO also provides clearer impact weighing, explaining why accountability enhances rather than undermines cooperation. CON's warnings about precedent and complexity are valid concerns but remain abstract compared to PRO's documented harms.\n\n**Confidence:** 0.72 - Clear winner but CON raised legitimate concerns about implementation complexity and international relations stability that weren't fully resolved.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence and weighing.
