  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents clear, structured arguments: youth already have responsibilities, early voting cultivates lifelong engagement, youth are informed via digital media, and equality principles support inclusion. Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized.\n\nCON counters with structured arguments about maturity requirements, inadequate civic education infrastructure, and susceptibility to manipulation. Arguments are internally consistent and clearly articulated.\n\nBoth sides maintain logical coherence throughout. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO cites Austria and Scotland as examples, references studies on habit formation and youth engagement, and provides reasoning about youth responsibilities (employment, taxes, driving). Evidence is relevant but somewhat general.\n\nCON acknowledges the Austria/Scotland examples but contextualizes them with civic education differences, notes the lack of uniform U.S. civic education, and provides reasoning about cognitive development and complexity of voting. Evidence is similarly general but well-integrated.\n\nBoth provide moderate support with examples and reasoning. PRO: 3, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO directly addresses CON's maturity concerns by arguing cognitive development doesn't preclude informed choices, responds to civic education concerns by advocating simultaneous improvement, and addresses misinformation concerns by noting they apply to all ages.\n\nCON directly refutes PRO's maturity argument by distinguishing life decisions from voting complexity, challenges the Austria/Scotland comparison by noting civic education differences, and critiques PRO's sequencing logic (\"cart before horse\").\n\nBoth engage substantively with opponent's arguments. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO emphasizes empowerment, democratic representation, lifelong engagement habits, and equality principles. However, weighing is more implicit than explicit - they don't clearly compare why their impacts outweigh CON's concerns.\n\nCON emphasizes electoral integrity, informed participation, and risks of manipulation. They explicitly weigh by stating \"potential risks...outweigh any perceived benefits\" and prioritize \"integrity of the electoral process.\"\n\nCON provides clearer comparative weighing. PRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nThis is a close debate with strong performance from both sides. The key differentiator is CON's superior impact weighing and their effective \"cart before horse\" argument that PRO never fully resolves. CON explicitly prioritizes electoral integrity over inclusion, while PRO's weighing remains more implicit. CON's argument that civic education must precede voting rights is logically compelling and PRO's response (do both simultaneously) doesn't adequately address why we should grant rights before ensuring preparation.\n\nHowever, PRO maintains strong engagement throughout and presents compelling arguments about youth capacity and democratic principles. The debate is competitive but CON edges ahead on weighing and the sequencing logic.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.6,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior impact weighing, explicitly prioritizing electoral integrity over inclusion and effectively arguing that civic education must precede voting rights.
