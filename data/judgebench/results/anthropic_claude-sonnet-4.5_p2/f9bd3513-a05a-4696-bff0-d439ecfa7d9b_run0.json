  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**Argument Quality Analysis:**\nPRO presents clear, structured arguments about reallocating funds to social services, with logical flow from effectiveness to systemic issues. CON counters with nuanced arguments about police roles and balanced approaches. Both sides maintain internal consistency. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding Analysis:**\nPRO cites specific evidence (National Institute of Justice study showing $1 spent saves $4, Treatment Advocacy Center report). CON references community policing initiatives and crisis intervention training but provides less specific sourcing. PRO grounds claims more concretely. PRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation Analysis:**\nPRO directly engages CON's points about police necessity, crisis response, and reform sufficiency. CON responds to PRO's over-policing claims and mental health arguments, but less directly addresses the cost-effectiveness evidence. Both engage substantively but PRO's rebuttals are more targeted. PRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing Analysis:**\nPRO consistently emphasizes magnitude (4:1 cost savings), scope (systemic inequalities), and moral imperative. CON argues for balanced approaches but doesn't comparatively weigh why maintaining police funding outweighs PRO's cost-benefit analysis. PRO provides clearer comparative framework. PRO: 4, CON: 2\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nPRO wins on superior evidence grounding (specific cost-benefit data), more direct clash, and clearer impact weighing. While CON raises legitimate concerns about public safety, they don't effectively counter PRO's quantified evidence or explain why their impacts outweigh the demonstrated cost savings and systemic benefits PRO presents.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding, particularly the quantified 4:1 cost-benefit ratio, and clearer impact weighing.
