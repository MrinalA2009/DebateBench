  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\n\nPRO: Presents three clear contentions (fairness, economic stability, service quality) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and internally consistent throughout. Score: 4\n\nCON: Also presents three clear contentions (worker autonomy, consumer choice, economic viability) with good logical flow. Arguments are well-structured and consistent. Score: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\n\nPRO: Cites Economic Policy Institute for poverty statistics, references research on tipping biases affecting marginalized workers, mentions studies on employee compensation and satisfaction. Evidence is integrated but somewhat general. Score: 3\n\nCON: Cites specific 2019 Cornell University study on server earnings, provides concrete mechanisms for claims. Evidence is more specific and directly supports contentions. Score: 4\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\n\nPRO: Directly addresses CON's Cornell study by noting it doesn't account for disparities, challenges the accountability argument, responds to economic burden claims with turnover/training cost arguments. Engages substantively. Score: 4\n\nCON: Directly refutes PRO's bias argument by questioning mechanism, challenges service quality claims, addresses economic feasibility with specific counterarguments about price increases and short-term costs. Strong engagement. Score: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\n\nPRO: Attempts weighing by emphasizing systemic inequality and long-term benefits, but doesn't explicitly compare magnitude/probability of impacts against CON's arguments. Limited comparative analysis. Score: 3\n\nCON: Points out that PRO's solution doesn't eliminate bias while removing earning potential, compares short-term vs long-term economic effects, highlights trade-offs between systems. More explicit comparative weighing. Score: 4\n\n**ANALYSIS**\n\nBoth sides presented competent cases with clear structure. The key differentiators:\n\n1. CON provided more specific evidence (Cornell study with details vs. general references)\n2. CON engaged in more explicit comparative weighing, particularly on economic impacts and the trade-off between capping income vs. addressing bias\n3. CON effectively challenged PRO's causal mechanisms (how does flat wage eliminate bias?)\n4. PRO's strongest argument about systemic bias was somewhat blunted by CON's point that changing payment structure doesn't eliminate societal bias\n\nThe debate was close, but CON's superior evidence specificity and comparative impact analysis (showing PRO's solution doesn't solve the stated problem while creating new harms) gives them the edge.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior evidence specificity and comparative weighing.
