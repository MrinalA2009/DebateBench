  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**Argument Quality Analysis:**\nPRO presents clear, structured arguments: victim empowerment, informed sentencing, and public trust. The logic flows coherently throughout.\nCON counters with concerns about bias, rehabilitation compromise, and victim trauma. Arguments are well-organized and internally consistent.\nBoth sides maintain clarity. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding Analysis:**\nPRO references \"research shows\" regarding victim satisfaction and closure, and claims about rehabilitation outcomes, but provides limited specific evidence.\nCON similarly references \"research suggests\" about rehabilitation factors but lacks concrete citations.\nBoth rely heavily on logical reasoning rather than detailed evidence. PRO: 3, CON: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation Analysis:**\nPRO directly addresses CON's bias concern by arguing current system has bias too, responds to rehabilitation concerns with accountability argument, and addresses trauma concern with supportive measures.\nCON effectively challenges PRO's objectivity assumption, questions the rehabilitation evidence, and maintains that risks outweigh benefits.\nBoth engage substantively with opponent's arguments. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**Impact Weighing Analysis:**\nPRO emphasizes dignity restoration, healing, and system integrity but doesn't explicitly compare magnitude of impacts against CON's concerns.\nCON explicitly weighs \"risks and unintended consequences...outweigh any perceived benefits\" and prioritizes fairness and rehabilitation as systemic values.\nCON provides clearer comparative weighing of competing values. PRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nCON edges ahead primarily on impact weighing, explicitly articulating why systemic fairness and rehabilitation concerns outweigh PRO's benefits. CON also effectively challenges PRO's evidence claims about rehabilitation while maintaining consistent focus on structural justice system principles. PRO makes strong empowerment arguments but doesn't adequately weigh these against systemic fairness concerns that CON raises.\n\nThe debate is close, but CON's superior comparative weighing and effective challenging of PRO's rehabilitation claims provides the edge.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.6,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior impact weighing, explicitly comparing systemic fairness concerns against PRO's benefits.
