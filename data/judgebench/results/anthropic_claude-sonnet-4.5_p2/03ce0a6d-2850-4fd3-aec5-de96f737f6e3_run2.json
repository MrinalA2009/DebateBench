  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO presents clear, structured arguments about conflict, exploitation, and shared heritage. Arguments are logically coherent and well-developed.\n- CON presents arguments about innovation, cooperation, and stewardship, but these are less internally consistent given the rebuttals that follow.\n- PRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO uses historical examples (scramble for Africa, resource wars), references the Outer Space Treaty, and provides concrete mechanisms (helium-3 example, profit motives).\n- CON mentions SpaceX/Blue Origin and Antarctic research as examples, but provides less detailed grounding for claims about how regulation would work.\n- PRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO directly engages CON's innovation, cooperation, and stewardship claims with specific counterarguments and historical precedent.\n- CON's rebuttal appears to largely restate PRO's arguments rather than defending their own position - they essentially concede PRO's points about conflict and inequality.\n- PRO: 5, CON: 2\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO clearly weighs impacts: international conflict, global inequality, environmental degradation, and explicitly states these outweigh hypothetical benefits.\n- CON mentions potential benefits but fails to comparatively weigh why innovation/cooperation would outweigh PRO's conflict/inequality impacts.\n- PRO: 4, CON: 2\n\n**Critical Issue:** CON's rebuttal is particularly problematic - it appears to argue PRO's case rather than defend CON's position, essentially conceding the major clash points about conflict and inequality.\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nPRO wins decisively through superior clash engagement and impact weighing. CON failed to defend their constructive arguments and essentially conceded PRO's framework in rebuttal.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively on clash and weighing.
