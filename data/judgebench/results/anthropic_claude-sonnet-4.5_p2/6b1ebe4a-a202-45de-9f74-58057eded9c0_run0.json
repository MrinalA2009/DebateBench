  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents three clear pillars: future job skills, cognitive development, and creativity. Arguments are well-structured and internally consistent throughout.\n\nCON presents three counter-arguments: curriculum overload, developmental appropriateness, and educational inequality. These are logically coherent and directly challenge PRO's framework.\n\nBoth sides maintain clarity. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING:**\n\nPRO cites Bureau of Labor Statistics (13% job growth), University of California study on logical reasoning, and references Finland/Singapore education systems. Uses ScratchJr as concrete example.\n\nCON relies more on logical reasoning about resource constraints and developmental psychology but provides less specific evidence. Arguments are grounded in educational theory but lack cited sources.\n\nPRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION:**\n\nPRO directly addresses all three CON arguments: curriculum overload (interdisciplinary approach), developmental concerns (ScratchJr example), and inequality (government support solution).\n\nCON effectively rebuts PRO's responses, distinguishing between \"computational thinking tools\" and \"formal programming,\" challenging the feasibility of interdisciplinary integration, and questioning the lack of concrete resource plans.\n\nBoth engage substantively. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING:**\n\nPRO emphasizes future employability, cognitive benefits across disciplines, and creativity as broad societal impacts. However, doesn't explicitly compare magnitude/probability against CON's harms.\n\nCON focuses on immediate harms (curriculum dilution, student frustration, worsening inequality) and challenges PRO's idealistic assumptions. Points out that PRO offers \"no concrete plan\" for resource distribution, making their benefits speculative.\n\nCON does better comparative weighing by highlighting the gap between PRO's vision and practical implementation. PRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nThis is a close debate. PRO has stronger evidence support, but CON performs better on comparative weighing and identifies critical implementation gaps. CON's distinction between \"computational thinking tools\" (like ScratchJr) and \"formal programming\" is a key analytical point that PRO doesn't adequately address. CON's argument that mandating programming without concrete resource plans would worsen inequality is more compelling than PRO's assertion that it would bridge the divide.\n\nThe decisive factor is CON's successful challenge to PRO's feasibility claims and superior impact comparison showing immediate, probable harms versus speculative future benefits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior impact weighing, effectively distinguishing between computational thinking tools and formal programming, and exposing PRO's lack of concrete implementation plans.
