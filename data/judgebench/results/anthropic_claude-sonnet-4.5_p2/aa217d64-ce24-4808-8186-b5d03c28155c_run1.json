  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\nPRO presents clear arguments centered on restorative justice principles, victim closure, and holistic justice. The structure is logical and internally consistent throughout.\nCON presents equally clear arguments about consistency, objectivity, and systemic integrity. Both sides maintain coherent positions.\nPRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\nPRO references empirical studies showing victim satisfaction and closure, mentions victim impact statements as existing tools, and cites reduced recidivism in restorative justice programs.\nCON relies more on logical reasoning about potential consequences (bias, inconsistency) but provides less concrete evidence. Arguments are more theoretical about what \"could\" happen.\nPRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\nPRO directly addresses CON's concerns about consistency (structured programs), \"innocent until proven guilty\" (sentencing occurs post-conviction), and rehabilitation effectiveness.\nCON engages with PRO's points about structured programs and restorative justice, arguing emotional influence persists despite guidelines. Both sides engage substantively.\nPRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\nPRO explicitly weighs impacts in the summary: \"benefits of victim involvement far outweigh the potential drawbacks,\" emphasizing victim satisfaction, reduced recidivism, and healing versus punishment.\nCON weighs systemic integrity and fairness against individual satisfaction but doesn't provide clear comparative analysis of magnitude or probability. The weighing is more implicit.\nPRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION**\nPRO wins on two key factors: (1) stronger evidence grounding with empirical support for claims, and (2) more explicit comparative weighing of impacts. PRO effectively neutralizes CON's main objection (inconsistency) by pointing to existing structured programs, while CON's response that judges remain susceptible is more speculative. PRO's post-conviction timing argument against the \"innocent until proven guilty\" concern is particularly strong and not adequately refuted by CON.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding with empirical support for restorative justice claims and more explicit comparative impact weighing.
