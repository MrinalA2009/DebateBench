  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\n\nPRO: Presents three clear contentions (fairness, economic stability, service quality) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and internally consistent throughout. Score: 4\n\nCON: Also presents three clear contentions (worker autonomy, consumer choice, economic viability) with good logical flow. Arguments are well-structured and consistent. Score: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\n\nPRO: Cites Economic Policy Institute and references research on bias in tipping. However, evidence is somewhat generic and lacks specific data points. Claims about customer willingness to pay higher prices are unsupported. Score: 3\n\nCON: Cites specific 2019 Cornell University study about server earnings. Provides concrete mechanisms for claims. However, also makes some unsupported assertions about price sensitivity and business closures. Score: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\n\nPRO: Directly engages CON's Cornell study by pointing out it doesn't account for bias. Responds to accountability argument by reframing service quality. Addresses economic burden with turnover argument. Score: 4\n\nCON: Effectively challenges PRO's bias solution by noting no mechanism to eliminate bias. Directly refutes service quality claims. Challenges customer willingness to pay as speculative. Strong engagement throughout. Score: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\n\nPRO: Attempts weighing by emphasizing systemic inequality affects all workers versus individual earning potential. Mentions long-term business benefits. However, doesn't clearly prioritize why fairness outweighs worker autonomy or explain magnitude comparisons. Score: 3\n\nCON: Points out that removing tipping creates \"far greater problems\" and emphasizes immediate economic harm to businesses. Notes that bias exists regardless of payment structure. However, doesn't provide clear comparative framework for why earning potential outweighs inequality. Score: 3\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION**\n\nBoth sides performed similarly across most categories. The debate is very close with matched scores in argument quality and clash (4-4), and evidence and weighing (3-3).\n\nThe key differentiator is in the clash phase: CON more effectively undermines PRO's core mechanism by noting that abolishing tipping doesn't actually solve bias - it just removes earning potential. PRO's response that higher wages create fairness doesn't address CON's point that bias will persist regardless of payment structure.\n\nAdditionally, CON's economic viability argument (immediate harm to small businesses) goes largely unrefuted by PRO's speculative claim about customer willingness to pay more, which CON effectively labels as unsupported.\n\nHowever, PRO maintains stronger ground on the systemic inequality issue, which CON doesn't fully resolve beyond saying exceptional workers can overcome it.\n\nThis is an extremely close debate, but CON edges ahead by more effectively challenging PRO's mechanisms while maintaining their own position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.55,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins a very close debate by effectively undermining PRO's mechanism - noting that abolishing tipping doesn't eliminate bias while removing earning potential for skilled workers.
