  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**Argument Quality Analysis:**\nPRO presents clear, structured arguments about conflict, exploitation, and shared heritage. The logic flows coherently from historical precedent to predicted outcomes.\nCON's constructive presents three clear contentions about innovation, cooperation, and stewardship, but the rebuttal appears to argue against their own position (stating ownership leads to conflict and inequality), creating internal contradiction.\n\nPRO: 5 (clear, consistent throughout)\nCON: 2 (major internal contradiction in rebuttal)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding Analysis:**\nPRO uses historical examples (scramble for Africa, resource wars), references the Outer Space Treaty, and provides concrete mechanisms (helium-3 example, profit motives).\nCON mentions SpaceX/Blue Origin and Antarctic cooperation model in constructive, but the rebuttal contradicts these points by citing the same historical examples PRO used to argue against ownership.\n\nPRO: 4 (good historical grounding and examples)\nCON: 2 (evidence contradicts own position)\n\n**Clash & Refutation Analysis:**\nPRO directly engages CON's innovation, cooperation, and stewardship claims with specific counterarguments about inequality, historical precedent, and profit motives.\nCON's rebuttal is problematic - it appears to argue PRO's position rather than defending CON's stance, stating \"regulated ownership will inherently lead to innovation and cooperation\" then immediately arguing against this claim.\n\nPRO: 5 (direct, effective engagement)\nCON: 1 (rebuttal argues opponent's position)\n\n**Impact Weighing Analysis:**\nPRO clearly weighs impacts: international conflict, global inequality, environmental degradation, with emphasis on irreversibility and catastrophic outcomes.\nCON's summary attempts weighing but is undermined by the contradictory rebuttal that actually supports PRO's impacts.\n\nPRO: 4 (clear comparative weighing)\nCON: 2 (attempted weighing contradicted by own arguments)\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nPRO wins decisively. CON's critical error in the rebuttal - where they argue against their own position - is fatal to their case. This isn't a close debate where weighing could overcome other deficiencies; CON essentially conceded the debate by adopting PRO's arguments in rebuttal.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 1\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively.
