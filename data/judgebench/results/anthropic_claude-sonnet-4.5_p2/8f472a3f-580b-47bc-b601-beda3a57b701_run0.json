  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\n\nPRO: Presents a clear thesis that nationalism creates \"us versus them\" mentality leading to erosion of cooperation, social tensions, and xenophobic policies. Arguments are logically structured and internally consistent throughout. Score: 4\n\nCON: Offers three clear contentions (identity/belonging, democratic governance, coexistence with global cooperation). Arguments are coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\n\nPRO: References historical examples (WWI, WWII), contemporary cases (America First, Brexit), and specific outcomes (hate crimes). Provides concrete mechanisms linking nationalism to negative outcomes. Score: 4\n\nCON: Provides Canada as a specific example of multiculturalism within nationalism. References civic engagement and voter turnout but with less specific evidence. Climate change cooperation mentioned but not deeply developed. Score: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\n\nPRO: Directly engages CON's unity argument, challenges the crisis response example, refutes democratic governance claim, and addresses global cooperation argument. Strong point-by-point engagement. Score: 4\n\nCON: Responds to marginalization claims with Canada example, addresses democratic governance criticism, and counters global cooperation concerns. However, less direct engagement with PRO's historical evidence and specific policy examples. Score: 3\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\n\nPRO: Explicitly weighs impacts in summary, arguing negative consequences \"far outweigh\" benefits. Frames opposition's examples as \"exceptions rather than the rule.\" Provides magnitude comparison (world wars, climate crisis vs. civic engagement). Score: 4\n\nCON: Claims constructive aspects \"outweigh\" negative consequences in summary. However, weighing is less developed\u2014doesn't explain why unity/civic engagement outweighs global cooperation erosion or minority marginalization in terms of magnitude, scope, or timeframe. Score: 2\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION**\n\nPRO wins on three of four criteria (Evidence, Clash, Weighing) with ties on Argument Quality. PRO provided more specific historical and contemporary evidence, engaged more directly with opponent's arguments, and offered clearer comparative weighing of impacts. CON's arguments about responsible nationalism were reasonable but less supported and less effectively weighed against PRO's concerns about global cooperation breakdown and minority marginalization.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence grounding (historical examples, specific policies), more direct clash with opponent's arguments, and clearer comparative impact weighing. While CON presented coherent arguments about nationalism's unifying potential, they failed to adequately weigh why civic engagement outweighs PRO's concerns about global cooperation erosion and minority marginalization.
