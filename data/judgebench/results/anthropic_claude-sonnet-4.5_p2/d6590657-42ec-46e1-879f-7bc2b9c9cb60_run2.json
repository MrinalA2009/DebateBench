  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents three clear contentions: common heritage preservation, conflict prevention, and scientific advancement promotion. Arguments are logically structured and internally consistent, citing the Outer Space Treaty as foundational support.\n\nCON presents three contentions: investment/innovation incentives, resource security, and facilitating human expansion. Arguments are coherent and well-developed, with clear causal chains linking ownership to desired outcomes.\n\nBoth sides maintain logical consistency throughout. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING:**\n\nPRO cites the Outer Space Treaty (1967, 100+ nations) and the International Space Station as concrete examples. However, relies heavily on historical analogies without specific mechanisms for how ownership leads to conflict in space.\n\nCON provides reasoning about capital-intensive nature of space exploration and finite Earth resources. Uses ISS as counter-example (government-funded vs. self-sustaining model). Less specific citation but stronger mechanistic reasoning about economic incentives.\n\nPRO: 3, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION:**\n\nPRO directly engages CON's investment argument, arguing it leads to exploitation. Addresses resource security by highlighting geopolitical tensions. Responds to expansion argument with ISS example.\n\nCON directly refutes monopolization concerns by clarifying they advocate regulated ownership. Challenges the Outer Space Treaty's effectiveness with stagnation claim. Distinguishes between ISS (government project) and sustainable economic models. More thorough engagement with opponent's framework.\n\nPRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING:**\n\nPRO emphasizes preventing conflict and inequality, arguing these outweigh economic benefits. However, doesn't clearly compare magnitude/probability of their impacts versus CON's.\n\nCON explicitly weighs: frames choice as \"stagnation vs. innovation,\" argues resource depletion is existential (\"long-term survival\"), and positions multi-planetary expansion as critical for species survival. More direct comparative weighing of impacts.\n\nPRO: 2, CON: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nCON wins on superior clash and weighing. While both sides presented quality arguments, CON more effectively:\n1. Refuted PRO's framework by challenging Outer Space Treaty effectiveness\n2. Distinguished between their regulated ownership model and PRO's characterization\n3. Provided clearer impact calculus (survival vs. potential conflict)\n4. Turned PRO's ISS example against them\n\nPRO's conflict prevention argument, while important, lacked specific mechanisms for why space ownership uniquely causes conflict compared to Earth-based property systems that CON analogized.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing and clash.
