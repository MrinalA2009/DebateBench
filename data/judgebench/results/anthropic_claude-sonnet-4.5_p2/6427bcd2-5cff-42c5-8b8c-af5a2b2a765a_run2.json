  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\n\nPRO: Presents three clear contentions (victim empowerment, informed sentencing, public trust) with logical structure. Arguments are coherent and internally consistent throughout. Score: 4\n\nCON: Also presents three clear contentions (inconsistency/bias, rehabilitation concerns, victim trauma). Arguments are well-structured and logically developed. Score: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\n\nPRO: References \"research shows\" regarding victim satisfaction and closure, but provides limited specific evidence. Claims about rehabilitation are supported by reasoning but lack concrete grounding. Score: 3\n\nCON: Similarly references \"research suggests\" but provides minimal specific evidence. Arguments rely more on logical reasoning than empirical support. Score: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\n\nPRO: Directly engages CON's three main arguments in rebuttal. Addresses bias concerns by noting current system has bias, counters rehabilitation argument with accountability framework, and responds to trauma concern with supportive measures. Score: 4\n\nCON: Effectively challenges PRO's assumptions about victim objectivity and questions the evidence for rehabilitation claims. Directly engages with PRO's main arguments and identifies logical gaps. Score: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\n\nPRO: Emphasizes dignity, healing, and system integrity but doesn't explicitly compare magnitude or probability of impacts against CON's concerns. Limited comparative weighing of why empowerment outweighs bias risks. Score: 3\n\nCON: Explicitly weighs \"risks and unintended consequences\" against \"perceived benefits\" in final summary. Prioritizes systemic fairness over individual empowerment, providing clearer comparative framework. Score: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION**\n\nThis is a close debate with similar argument quality and clash. The key differentiator is CON's superior impact weighing - explicitly comparing systemic fairness concerns against individual benefits and explaining why fairness/consistency should take priority. CON also more effectively challenges PRO's empirical claims about rehabilitation while PRO's responses rely more on assertion. CON's framework of prioritizing systemic integrity over individual empowerment provides clearer comparative analysis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior impact weighing, explicitly comparing systemic fairness concerns against individual benefits and prioritizing consistency in the justice system. Both sides clashed effectively, but CON provided clearer comparative analysis of why preventing bias and maintaining fairness outweighs victim empowerment benefits, while more effectively challenging PRO's rehabilitation claims.\"\n}\n```",
