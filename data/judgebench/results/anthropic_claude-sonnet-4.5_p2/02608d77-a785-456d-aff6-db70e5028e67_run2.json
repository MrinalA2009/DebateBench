  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**Argument Quality Analysis:**\nPRO presents clear, structured arguments about criminal impunity and equality before law. The logic flows coherently from premise to conclusion. CON counters with the Vienna Convention framework and existing mechanisms, though the argument about complexity in distinguishing official/non-official acts is somewhat underdeveloped. Both sides maintain internal consistency.\n\nPRO: 4 (Clear and well-structured)\nCON: 4 (Clear and coherent)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding Analysis:**\nPRO cites specific evidence (BBC report of 5,000+ crimes in UK over 5 years with virtually no prosecutions), which is concrete and relevant. This is repeated effectively to ground their claims. CON relies more on theoretical frameworks (Vienna Convention, sending state jurisdiction) but provides no counter-evidence to PRO's statistics or examples of successful prosecutions by sending states. CON's claim that crimes are \"extremely rare\" contradicts PRO's unchallenged evidence.\n\nPRO: 4 (Strong, specific evidence)\nCON: 3 (Theoretical support but lacks concrete evidence)\n\n**Clash & Refutation Analysis:**\nPRO directly engages CON's arguments about sending state jurisdiction and expulsion, explaining why these are insufficient (reactive not preventative, rare prosecution). PRO addresses the retaliation concern by clarifying they seek limitation, not abolition. CON engages with PRO's proposal but doesn't effectively refute the core evidence about 5,000 crimes. CON's claim that instances are \"extremely rare\" directly contradicts PRO's evidence without providing counter-evidence.\n\nPRO: 4 (Direct, effective engagement)\nCON: 3 (Some engagement but incomplete refutation)\n\n**Impact Weighing Analysis:**\nPRO clearly weighs justice for victims and rule of law against diplomatic functionality, arguing that targeted limitations would strengthen rather than weaken cooperation by building trust. CON weighs stability of international relations and warns of precedent-setting, but doesn't comparatively weigh why diplomatic stability outweighs justice for 5,000+ crime victims. PRO's weighing is more explicit and comparative.\n\nPRO: 4 (Clear comparative weighing)\nCON: 3 (Some weighing but less comparative)\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nPRO wins on evidence strength (unchallenged statistics), more effective clash (directly refuting CON's mechanisms as insufficient), and clearer impact weighing (explaining why accountability enhances rather than undermines cooperation). CON's theoretical arguments about existing mechanisms are undermined by PRO's concrete evidence of their failure in practice. The distinction between limitation and abolition that PRO maintains throughout effectively neutralizes CON's slippery slope concerns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence (5,000+ unchallenged crimes) and effective refutation showing existing mechanisms fail in practice.
