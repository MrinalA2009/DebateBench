  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**Argument Quality Analysis:**\nPRO presents clear, structured arguments: victim empowerment, informed sentencing, and public trust. The logic flows coherently throughout.\nCON counters with three clear concerns: inconsistent outcomes, compromised rehabilitation, and victim trauma. Both sides maintain internal consistency.\nBoth sides score similarly here.\n\n**Evidence & Grounding Analysis:**\nPRO references \"research shows\" regarding victim satisfaction and closure, and claims about rehabilitation outcomes when offenders understand consequences.\nCON also references \"research suggests\" about rehabilitation factors but provides similar levels of specificity.\nBoth rely on general research claims without detailed citations, making this relatively even.\n\n**Clash & Refutation Analysis:**\nPRO directly addresses CON's three main concerns in rebuttal: responds to bias concerns by noting current system has bias, addresses rehabilitation by claiming victim input promotes it, and handles trauma concerns by noting many feel empowered.\nCON responds to PRO's rebuttal points, challenging the objectivity assumption and questioning the rehabilitation evidence. However, CON's rebuttal is somewhat less direct in engaging PRO's original three contentions (dignity/empowerment, informed decisions, public trust).\n\n**Impact Weighing Analysis:**\nPRO emphasizes dignity restoration, healing, and system integrity as overarching values. In rebuttal, explicitly states benefits \"outweigh\" concerns.\nCON states risks \"outweigh\" benefits in the summary, but provides less comparative analysis of why fairness/rehabilitation concerns should be prioritized over victim empowerment.\nPRO provides slightly clearer comparative weighing throughout.\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nThis is a close debate. Both sides present coherent arguments with similar evidence quality. The key differentiator is that PRO more directly engages all of CON's arguments while providing clearer comparative weighing. CON's rebuttal focuses heavily on challenging PRO's responses but less on defending against PRO's original contentions about public trust and informed decision-making. PRO's framework of \"not outweighing benefits\" is more explicitly comparative than CON's approach.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.6,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior clash and weighing.
