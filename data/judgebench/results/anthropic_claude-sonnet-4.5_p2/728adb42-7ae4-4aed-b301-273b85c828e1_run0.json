  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents three clear contentions: inclusivity (21% speak non-English at home), cognitive development (bilingual students outperform peers), and global competitiveness (job postings requiring bilingual skills doubled). Arguments are well-structured and coherent.\n\nCON presents three contentions: logistical/financial burdens (350+ languages, teacher shortage), diluted educational quality, and infringement on local control. Arguments are logical and internally consistent.\n\nBoth sides maintain clarity throughout. Score: PRO 4, CON 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO cites: 21% population statistic, American Council on Teaching of Foreign Languages report, New American Economy study, Center for Applied Linguistics research, and specific examples (San Francisco, Miami programs).\n\nCON cites: 350+ languages statistic, National Center for Education Statistics on teacher shortage. However, CON relies more heavily on logical reasoning about resource constraints than empirical evidence.\n\nPRO provides more specific evidence and examples. Score: PRO 4, CON 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO directly addresses CON's logistical concerns by proposing focus on prevalent languages and citing existing successful programs. Responds to quality concerns with research showing bilingual students outperform peers. Addresses local control by suggesting standardized approach with community input.\n\nCON effectively rebuts PRO's \"prevalent languages\" solution as superficial, distinguishes voluntary well-resourced programs from mandatory underfunded ones, and challenges the cost-savings claim. CON's rebuttal that PRO's evidence comes from voluntary programs is particularly strong.\n\nBoth sides engage directly. CON's distinction between voluntary and mandatory programs is a crucial clash point. Score: PRO 3, CON 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO emphasizes long-term benefits: inclusivity for 21% of population, cognitive advantages, and global competitiveness. Frames as \"investment in our future.\"\n\nCON explicitly weighs impacts in summary, contrasting \"practicality versus idealism\" and arguing that mandatory implementation would \"hinder English proficiency and academic rigor for all students\" - affecting the entire student population versus PRO's benefits.\n\nCON provides clearer comparative weighing by highlighting that their negative impacts affect all students while PRO's benefits depend on proper implementation. Score: PRO 3, CON 4\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**\n\nCON wins on clash and weighing, making the crucial distinction that PRO's evidence comes from voluntary, well-resourced programs while a mandate would create an underfunded system. CON effectively argues their impacts (affecting all students through diluted quality) outweigh PRO's benefits. PRO has stronger evidence but doesn't adequately respond to the voluntary vs. mandatory distinction that CON raises.\n\nThe debate turns on whether existing successful programs can scale to a mandate - CON wins this clash by distinguishing implementation contexts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by effectively distinguishing voluntary well-resourced programs from mandatory underfunded implementation, a clash PRO never adequately resolves. CON's comparative weighing that negative impacts affect all students while PRO's benefits require proper resourcing proves decisive. CON's rebuttal strategy undermines PRO's evidentiary foundation by questioning scalability and context.\"\n}\n```",
