  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**Argument Quality Analysis:**\nPRO presents three clear, structured contentions: division, authoritarianism, and undermining global cooperation. The arguments are logically coherent and well-organized.\nCON also presents three clear counter-arguments: nationalism as unifying, not inherently authoritarian, and compatible with global cooperation. Both sides maintain internal consistency.\nScore: PRO 4, CON 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding Analysis:**\nPRO provides specific examples: US/UK polarization, Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, COVID-19 resource hoarding. These are concrete and relevant.\nCON offers: post-WWII US civil rights, European Union as a model, but these examples are more general and less developed. CON's EU example lacks specific mechanisms.\nScore: PRO 4, CON 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation Analysis:**\nPRO directly engages CON's examples, pointing out McCarthyism alongside civil rights progress, and challenging the EU model with COVID-19 evidence.\nCON responds to PRO's critiques but often deflects (\"not inherent to nationalism,\" \"result of misuse\") without fully addressing PRO's specific examples. CON's rebuttal that \"manipulation of nationalist sentiments\" is the problem, not nationalism itself, is somewhat circular.\nScore: PRO 4, CON 3\n\n**Impact Weighing Analysis:**\nPRO consistently emphasizes the magnitude of impacts: erosion of democracy, individual freedoms, global crisis management. They explicitly connect nationalism to \"pressing transnational challenges.\"\nCON attempts weighing in the summary (\"balanced approach offers more benefits\") but doesn't develop comparative analysis of magnitude, probability, or timeframe. CON doesn't explain why their positive examples outweigh PRO's harms.\nScore: PRO 4, CON 2\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nPRO maintains stronger evidence throughout, provides more effective clash by directly addressing CON's examples with counter-evidence, and offers clearer impact weighing. CON's central defense\u2014that nationalism's problems stem from \"misuse\" rather than being inherent\u2014weakens their position since the resolution concerns nationalism \"in modern politics\" as practiced, not in theory. PRO's COVID-19 example effectively counters CON's EU cooperation claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence integration and impact weighing.
