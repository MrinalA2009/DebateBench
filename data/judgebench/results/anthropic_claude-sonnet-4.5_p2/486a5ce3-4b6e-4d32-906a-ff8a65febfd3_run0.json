  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\n\nPRO: Presents clear, structured contentions about systemic discrimination, enforcement mechanisms, and economic benefits. Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized throughout. Score: 4\n\nCON: Makes coherent arguments about unintended consequences and complexity, but the logic is less developed. The claim about job losses lacks clear connection to pay equity mandates specifically. Score: 3\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\n\nPRO: Cites specific statistics (82 cents on the dollar), references the AAUW 2020 study with clear application, and provides Iceland as a concrete example of successful implementation. Evidence is well-integrated. Score: 4\n\nCON: References NBER study but admits it focuses on minimum wage (different mechanism), weakening the relevance. Lacks specific data or examples beyond general assertions about complexity. Score: 2\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\n\nPRO: Directly addresses CON's job loss argument by challenging the NBER study's relevance, refutes the \"personal choices\" argument with the AAUW study, and effectively counters the voluntary initiatives claim with historical evidence of failure. Score: 5\n\nCON: Engages with PRO's arguments but responses are weaker. Admits Iceland example exists but dismisses it as non-replicable without evidence. Doesn't effectively counter the AAUW study's controlled findings. Score: 3\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\n\nPRO: Clearly weighs economic stimulation and poverty reduction against speculative job losses. Emphasizes magnitude (decades of stagnation) and probability (proven success in Iceland). Score: 4\n\nCON: Mentions potential job losses but doesn't comparatively weigh this against PRO's impacts. Calls economic benefits \"speculative\" but doesn't explain why job losses are more probable or significant. Score: 2\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION**\n\nPRO wins on superior evidence quality (AAUW study directly addresses discrimination after controlling for factors), stronger clash (effectively dismantles CON's NBER citation), and better weighing (concrete examples vs. speculative harms). CON's strongest argument about complexity is undermined by admitting the AAUW study controls for relevant factors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence integration and clash.
