  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\n\nPRO presents clear, structured arguments: (1) environmental impact with specific pollution comparisons, (2) social inequity and resource allocation. Arguments are internally consistent and well-developed.\n\nCON presents four main points: economic impact, essential functions, innovation potential, and social equity complexity. However, CON's rebuttal appears to contradict their constructive by agreeing with PRO's economic redirection argument, creating internal inconsistency.\n\nPRO: 5, CON: 3\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\n\nPRO cites specific data (Transport & Environment 2023 report, 5-14x more polluting than commercial planes, 50x more than trains). This grounds their environmental claims effectively.\n\nCON makes assertions about economic contributions (\"billions in revenue,\" \"hundreds of thousands of jobs\") without specific sources or data. Claims about essential functions and green technology development lack concrete support.\n\nPRO: 5, CON: 2\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\n\nPRO directly engages CON's arguments, calling the economic argument a \"red herring,\" addressing the essential functions claim as \"gross exaggeration,\" and challenging the green technology timeline as \"dangerous deferral.\"\n\nCON's rebuttal is problematic - it appears to agree with PRO's position (\"Redirecting resources...can create far more jobs\") rather than defending their own case. This represents poor clash management.\n\nPRO: 5, CON: 2\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\n\nPRO emphasizes urgency (\"immediate action,\" \"cannot wait\"), magnitude (climate crisis), and compares luxury consumption against collective responsibility. They frame the debate as immediate environmental necessity versus speculative future solutions.\n\nCON attempts weighing by discussing economic impacts and essential functions but fails to explain why these outweigh environmental concerns. No clear comparative framework is established.\n\nPRO: 5, CON: 2\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION**\n\nPRO wins decisively. They provided specific evidence, maintained internal consistency, directly refuted opponent arguments, and established clear impact weighing around urgency and magnitude. CON's case suffered from lack of evidence, internal contradictions (especially in rebuttal), and failure to establish why their impacts outweigh PRO's environmental concerns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively through specific evidence (Transport & Environment data), effective refutation of CON's economic and essential functions claims, and clear impact weighing emphasizing urgency versus speculative solutions.
