  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**Argument Quality Analysis:**\nPRO presents a clear framework (moral, economic, social implications) and maintains consistent structure throughout. Their arguments are coherent and logically connected.\nCON also presents clear arguments with a defined framework (efficacy and unintended consequences). They effectively challenge PRO's foundational statistics and present alternative interpretations.\n\n**Evidence & Grounding Analysis:**\nPRO cites US Census Bureau (82 cents), Equal Pay Act of 1963, Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, and AAUW 2020 study (7% gap after controls).\nCON cites Glassdoor 2018 study (4.9% adjusted gap) and provides specific mechanisms for why the gap narrows when controlling for variables. CON's evidence directly challenges PRO's statistical foundation.\n\n**Clash & Refutation Analysis:**\nPRO addresses CON's statistical challenge by citing the AAUW study showing 7% gap remains after controls, and defends past legislation as successful.\nCON directly engages PRO's 82-cent statistic, challenges the AAUW methodology, distinguishes between overt discrimination laws and mandates for adjusted gaps, and questions the relevance of PRO's historical examples. CON provides more granular refutation.\n\n**Impact Weighing Analysis:**\nPRO emphasizes economic growth, poverty reduction, and gender equality but doesn't comparatively weigh against CON's concerns.\nCON explicitly weighs unintended consequences (job losses, reduced innovation, harm to small businesses) against PRO's benefits and argues their market-based approach is \"more sustainable and less harmful.\" CON provides clearer comparative weighing.\n\n**Critical Debate Moments:**\n1. The statistical dispute is central: CON's 4.9% adjusted gap vs PRO's 7% creates ambiguity about magnitude\n2. CON effectively distinguishes between laws addressing overt discrimination and mandates for remaining gaps\n3. PRO doesn't adequately respond to unintended consequences argument\n4. CON's framework of \"efficacy and unintended consequences\" is more directly applied than PRO's broader framework\n\nCON wins on clash and weighing, while evidence is competitive. CON's comparative analysis of why their approach is superior gives them the edge in a close debate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior comparative weighing and clash.
