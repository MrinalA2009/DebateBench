  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents three clear contentions: inclusivity (21% non-English speakers), cognitive development (improved problem-solving), and global competitiveness (doubled job postings). Arguments are structured and coherent.\n\nCON presents three contentions: logistical/financial burdens (350+ languages, teacher shortage), diluted educational quality, and infringement on local control. Arguments are well-structured and internally consistent.\n\nBoth sides maintain clarity throughout. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO cites: 21% population statistic, American Council on Teaching of Foreign Languages report, New American Economy study, Center for Applied Linguistics research, and specific city examples (San Francisco, Miami).\n\nCON cites: 350+ languages statistic, National Center for Education Statistics on teacher shortage. CON relies more on logical reasoning about resource constraints than empirical evidence.\n\nPRO provides more specific evidence and sources. PRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO directly addresses CON's logistical concerns by proposing focus on prevalent languages and citing existing successful programs. Responds to quality concerns with research showing bilingual students outperform peers. Addresses local control by suggesting standardized approach with community input.\n\nCON directly refutes PRO's \"prevalent languages\" solution as superficial, challenges the ESL savings claim as false equivalency, and distinguishes voluntary well-resourced programs from mandatory underfunded systems. CON effectively points out that PRO's evidence comes from voluntary programs, not mandatory systems.\n\nBoth engage substantively. CON's distinction between voluntary and mandatory programs is particularly effective. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO emphasizes long-term benefits: inclusivity in diverse society, cognitive advantages, and global competitiveness. Frames as \"investment in our future.\"\n\nCON explicitly weighs impacts in final speech, contrasting \"practicality versus idealism\" and arguing that mandatory underfunded system would \"hinder English proficiency and academic rigor for all students.\" CON frames the choice as between well-resourced voluntary programs versus poorly-resourced mandatory ones.\n\nCON provides clearer comparative weighing by explicitly contrasting the two approaches and explaining why their impacts (system-wide quality degradation) outweigh PRO's benefits. PRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nThis is a close debate. PRO has stronger evidence volume, but CON provides more effective comparative analysis. The critical clash centers on feasibility: PRO argues successful models exist and can scale; CON argues mandatory implementation would fundamentally differ from voluntary programs and create system-wide problems.\n\nCON's distinction between voluntary well-resourced programs (PRO's evidence base) and mandatory underfunded systems (the actual proposal) is a significant analytical advantage that PRO never fully addresses. CON also provides clearer impact weighing in the final speech, explicitly comparing the two worlds.\n\nWhile PRO presents more evidence, CON's comparative weighing and effective refutation of PRO's evidence applicability gives them the edge in this close debate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.6,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing and effective refutation. CON's distinction between voluntary well-resourced programs (PRO's evidence base) and mandatory underfunded systems undermines PRO's empirical support. CON's explicit comparative analysis of practicality versus idealism, combined with clear weighing of system-wide quality degradation, outweighs PRO's stronger evidence volume in this close debate.\"\n}\n```",
