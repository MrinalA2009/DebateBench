  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents clear, structured contentions about wage instability and discrimination/harassment. Arguments are logically coherent and well-developed throughout.\n\nCON presents arguments about service incentives and income flexibility, but notably in the rebuttal appears to argue AGAINST their own position (stating \"this system can lead to inconsistent service quality\" and \"this so-called flexibility is a double-edged sword\"). This creates significant internal contradiction and confusion about CON's actual stance.\n\nPRO: 5 (Clear, consistent throughout)\nCON: 2 (Major internal contradictions in rebuttal)\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING:**\n\nPRO cites specific sources: One Fair Wage 2021 study (poverty rates), ROC United studies (harassment data). These are integrated into arguments with specific claims.\n\nCON cites Cornell University study and National Restaurant Association, but provides less specific data. The evidence is more generic.\n\nPRO: 4 (Good specific evidence)\nCON: 3 (Some evidence but less detailed)\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION:**\n\nPRO directly engages CON's service incentive argument, flexibility claim, and job loss concern. Each rebuttal addresses opponent's specific points.\n\nCON's rebuttal is problematic - it appears to concede or even support PRO's arguments rather than refute them. The rebuttal undermines CON's own constructive case.\n\nPRO: 5 (Direct, effective engagement)\nCON: 2 (Contradicts own position)\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING:**\n\nPRO explicitly weighs impacts in summary: \"financial stability for millions of service workers, reduced discrimination, and a more equitable economy\" against \"exploitative system.\" Clear comparative framing.\n\nCON provides some weighing about service quality and worker preference but doesn't effectively compare magnitude or scope of impacts against PRO's poverty and harassment claims.\n\nPRO: 4 (Clear comparative weighing)\nCON: 2 (Limited comparative analysis)\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nPRO wins decisively. The critical factor is CON's self-contradictory rebuttal that actually supports PRO's case. CON argues that tipping creates \"inconsistent service quality\" and that income flexibility is \"a double-edged sword\" creating \"financial instability\" - these are PRO's arguments. This fundamental error, combined with PRO's stronger evidence and clearer impact weighing, makes this a clear PRO victory.\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** 0.85 (Clear winner due to CON's critical error, though CON had some valid initial arguments)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively.
