  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**Argument Quality Analysis:**\nPRO presents clear, structured arguments about conflict, exploitation, and shared heritage. The logic flows coherently from historical precedent to predicted outcomes.\nCON's constructive presents three distinct contentions, but the rebuttal and summary appear to adopt PRO's position, creating severe internal contradiction. CON's rebuttal states \"my opponent's arguments hinge on the assumption that regulated ownership will inherently lead to innovation\" - but this describes CON's own position, not PRO's. This fundamental confusion undermines CON's entire case.\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\nPRO uses historical examples (scramble for Africa, resource wars, Outer Space Treaty) and logical mechanisms (profit motives, enforcement difficulties).\nCON cites SpaceX/Blue Origin and Antarctic cooperation in constructive, but the rebuttal contradicts its own case by arguing against ownership using the same examples PRO used.\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\nPRO directly engages CON's innovation, cooperation, and stewardship claims with specific counterarguments.\nCON's rebuttal is fatally flawed - it refutes its own constructive position rather than PRO's arguments. The summary continues this error, arguing that \"ownership would lead to significant risks\" when CON is supposed to defend ownership.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\nPRO clearly weighs conflict, inequality, and environmental degradation as catastrophic outcomes.\nCON provides no comparative weighing in favor of its position after the constructive, as the rebuttal/summary argue for PRO's side.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is an unusual case where CON appears to have conceded or switched sides mid-debate. CON's rebuttal and summary argue against ownership, directly contradicting its constructive. This represents either a complete concession or a fundamental error that makes CON's position incoherent. PRO wins decisively.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 1\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 1\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 1\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON's rebuttal and summary directly contradict its constructive case, arguing against ownership rather than defending it.
