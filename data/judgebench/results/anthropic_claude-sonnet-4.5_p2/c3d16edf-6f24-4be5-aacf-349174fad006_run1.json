  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\n\nPRO: Presents a clear position that diplomatic immunity should be limited to promote justice and accountability. Arguments are coherent but somewhat repetitive across speeches. The distinction between \"official acts\" and \"personal actions\" is introduced but not fully developed with specific mechanisms. Score: 3\n\nCON: Offers well-structured arguments about the necessity of diplomatic immunity for international relations, the Vienna Convention's importance, and existing accountability mechanisms. Arguments are logically consistent and clearly articulated throughout. Score: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\n\nPRO: Makes assertions about \"numerous cases\" of diplomatic abuse but provides no specific examples or data. Claims about how \"most diplomats already operate within a framework of respect\" lack supporting evidence. Relies heavily on general principles without concrete grounding. Score: 2\n\nCON: References the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as a specific legal framework, explains existing mechanisms (waivers, persona non grata), and provides logical reasoning about reciprocity in international relations. Better grounded in established international law frameworks. Score: 4\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\n\nPRO: Engages with CON's Vienna Convention argument by calling it \"outdated\" and addresses the retaliation concern by claiming it's \"unfounded.\" However, responses are somewhat superficial and don't fully engage with CON's mechanistic arguments about how limitation would work in practice. Score: 3\n\nCON: Directly addresses PRO's \"official vs. personal acts\" distinction by questioning who would make such determinations. Challenges PRO's characterization of the Vienna Convention and responds to the retaliation argument with reciprocity logic. More thorough engagement with opponent's specific claims. Score: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\n\nPRO: Claims impacts of accountability and equality \"far outweigh the potential risks\" but doesn't provide comparative analysis of magnitude, probability, or timeframe. Asserts benefits without detailed weighing against CON's impacts. Score: 2\n\nCON: Explicitly weighs \"speculative promise of increased accountability against the very real and immediate threat of destabilized international relations.\" Provides comparative framework discussing the immediacy and certainty of harms versus benefits. Score: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION**\n\nCON wins across all four categories with stronger argument structure, better grounding in international law, more effective clash, and clearer comparative weighing. CON successfully defended the status quo by explaining existing accountability mechanisms while demonstrating concrete harms from limitation. PRO's case relied heavily on assertions without sufficient evidence or detailed mechanisms for implementation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins decisively by grounding arguments in the Vienna Convention framework, explaining existing accountability mechanisms, and providing clear comparative weighing between speculative benefits and concrete harms. PRO relied on unsupported assertions about abuse without evidence and failed to adequately address CON's mechanistic concerns about the unworkability of distinguishing official versus personal acts.\"\n}\n```",
