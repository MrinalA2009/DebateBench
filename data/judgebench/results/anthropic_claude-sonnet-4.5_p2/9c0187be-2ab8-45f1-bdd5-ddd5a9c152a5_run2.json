  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents a clear, coherent case: unrestricted tourism commodifies culture, creates social disruption, and nations need sovereign rights to implement restrictions. The logic flows consistently from cultural vulnerability \u2192 tourism pressure \u2192 need for protective rights.\n\nCON's arguments are also clear but contain some internal tension. They argue against restrictions while advocating for \"sustainable tourism practices\" and citing examples (Japan, Bhutan) that actually use restrictions. This creates logical inconsistency.\n\nPRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING:**\n\nPRO provides specific examples (Maasai ceremonies, Venice overtourism) with mechanisms explaining how tourism causes harm (staged authenticity, pricing out residents, social disruption).\n\nCON offers examples (Japan, Bhutan) but these actually undermine their position since these countries DO restrict tourism. They assert economic benefits and cross-cultural understanding but provide less mechanistic explanation of how unrestricted tourism preserves culture.\n\nPRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION:**\n\nPRO directly engages CON's arguments, pointing out that sustainable tourism examples (Japan/Bhutan) actually support PRO's case since they use restrictions. PRO addresses the discrimination concern as a \"red herring\" and explains the power imbalance in tourist-host dynamics.\n\nCON engages with PRO's examples but doesn't effectively resolve the contradiction that their own examples use restrictions. They raise paternalism concerns but don't adequately respond to PRO's sovereignty framing.\n\nPRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING:**\n\nPRO weighs cultural preservation as fundamental to national sovereignty and identity, arguing cultural costs outweigh economic benefits. They frame restrictions as empowerment, not isolation.\n\nCON emphasizes economic benefits and cross-cultural understanding but doesn't comparatively weigh why these outweigh cultural erosion. They don't explain why economic dependency is preferable to cultural preservation.\n\nPRO: 4, CON: 2\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nPRO wins on multiple fronts: (1) stronger internal consistency, (2) better use of evidence including turning CON's examples, (3) more effective clash by exposing contradictions in CON's case, and (4) clearer comparative weighing of cultural preservation vs. economic benefits. CON's fatal flaw is advocating for sustainable practices while opposing the restrictions that enable them.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins by exposing a critical contradiction in CON's case: CON's own examples (Japan, Bhutan) use restrictions to achieve sustainable tourism, directly supporting PRO's position.
