  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents three clear contentions: common heritage preservation, conflict prevention, and scientific advancement promotion. Arguments are logically structured and internally consistent, citing the Outer Space Treaty as foundational support.\n\nCON presents three contentions: investment/innovation incentives, resource security, and facilitating human expansion. Arguments are coherent and well-developed, with clear causal chains linking ownership to desired outcomes.\n\nBoth sides maintain logical consistency throughout. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO cites the Outer Space Treaty (1967, 100+ nations) and the International Space Station as concrete examples. However, relies heavily on historical analogies without specific mechanisms for how ownership leads to conflict in space.\n\nCON provides reasoning about capital-intensive nature of space exploration and finite Earth resources. Uses ISS as counter-example (government-funded vs. self-sustaining model). Less specific evidence but stronger mechanistic reasoning about economic incentives.\n\nPRO: 3, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO directly engages CON's investment argument, arguing it leads to exploitation. Addresses resource security by highlighting geopolitical tensions. Responds to expansion argument with ISS example.\n\nCON directly refutes monopolization concerns by clarifying they advocate regulated ownership. Addresses conflict argument by proposing international legal frameworks. Distinguishes between ISS (government project) and sustainable economic models. CON's rebuttals are more surgical and specific.\n\nPRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO emphasizes preventing inequality and conflict, framing space as belonging to \"all humanity.\" Argues ownership diverts resources from climate change and poverty. However, doesn't clearly compare magnitude of these impacts against CON's survival/resource security claims.\n\nCON explicitly weighs: frames choice as \"stagnation vs. innovation,\" argues resource depletion is existential (\"long-term human survival\"), and positions multi-planetary expansion as critical for species survival. Directly compares their impacts to PRO's by calling common heritage \"well-intentioned but ineffective.\"\n\nPRO: 2, CON: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nCON wins this debate through superior clash and weighing. While both sides present coherent arguments, CON more effectively:\n1. Refutes PRO's monopolization concerns by clarifying regulated ownership framework\n2. Distinguishes ISS collaboration from sustainable economic models\n3. Frames the debate as existential (species survival via resource access) vs. procedural (maintaining treaty principles)\n4. Directly compares outcomes: stagnation under current model vs. progress through ownership\n\nPRO's strongest argument about conflict prevention is undermined by CON's response about international legal frameworks. PRO doesn't adequately respond to CON's core economic incentive argument or explain how collaboration alone solves resource scarcity without ownership mechanisms.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing and clash.
