  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\nPRO presents three clear, structured claims: division, authoritarianism, and undermining global cooperation. Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized throughout.\nCON also presents three structured counter-arguments about unity, democratic foundations, and balanced cooperation. Arguments are clear and internally consistent.\nBoth sides maintain logical coherence. Score: PRO 4, CON 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\nPRO provides specific examples: US/UK polarization, Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, COVID-19 pandemic resource hoarding, McCarthyism. These examples are integrated to support claims.\nCON provides examples: post-WWII US civil rights advances, European Union as a model of balanced nationalism. However, CON relies more heavily on theoretical assertions about \"healthy nationalism\" without as much concrete grounding.\nPRO's evidence is more specific and numerous. Score: PRO 4, CON 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\nPRO directly engages CON's examples, challenging the post-WWII narrative by introducing McCarthyism, addressing the authoritarianism claim with historical patterns, and countering the EU example with COVID-19 pandemic behavior.\nCON responds to PRO's examples but often deflects rather than directly refutes (e.g., claiming nationalism isn't the cause but its \"manipulation\" is, without clearly distinguishing the two). CON acknowledges PRO's McCarthyism point but doesn't fully resolve the tension.\nPRO engages more directly with opponent's specific claims. Score: PRO 4, CON 3\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\nPRO consistently emphasizes the magnitude of impacts: erosion of democracy, threats to individual freedoms, failure to address global challenges like pandemics. In the summary, PRO explicitly weighs these as \"overwhelming evidence.\"\nCON attempts weighing in the final summary, stating \"a balanced approach to nationalism offers more benefits than the affirmative's blanket condemnation,\" but this is asserted rather than comparatively analyzed. CON doesn't explain why unity benefits outweigh democratic erosion risks.\nPRO provides clearer comparative weighing of impacts. Score: PRO 4, CON 2\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**\nPRO maintains stronger evidence throughout, engages more directly with CON's arguments, and provides clearer impact weighing. While CON presents coherent theoretical arguments about \"healthy nationalism,\" they struggle to demonstrate this exists in practice or outweighs PRO's concrete harms. PRO's examples of division, authoritarianism, and failed cooperation are more grounded and directly supported than CON's theoretical benefits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence integration and impact weighing.
