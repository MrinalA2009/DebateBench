  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents three clear contentions: inclusivity (21% speak non-English at home), cognitive development (bilingual students outperform peers), and global competitiveness (job postings requiring bilingual skills doubled). Arguments are well-structured and coherent.\n\nCON presents three counter-contentions: logistical/financial burdens (350+ languages, teacher shortage), diluted educational quality, and infringement on local control. Arguments are logical and internally consistent.\n\nBoth sides maintain clarity throughout. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING:**\n\nPRO cites: 21% population statistic, American Council on Teaching of Foreign Languages report, New American Economy study, Center for Applied Linguistics research, and specific examples (San Francisco, Miami programs).\n\nCON cites: 350+ languages statistic, National Center for Education Statistics on teacher shortage. However, CON relies more heavily on logical reasoning about resource constraints than empirical evidence.\n\nPRO provides more concrete evidence and examples. PRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION:**\n\nPRO directly addresses CON's three main concerns: responds to logistics by citing existing successful programs and dual-language models; counters quality concerns with research showing bilingual students outperform peers; addresses local control by proposing standardized approach with community input.\n\nCON effectively rebuts PRO's responses: challenges the \"most prevalent languages\" solution as superficial given 350+ languages; disputes the savings claim as false equivalency; distinguishes voluntary well-resourced programs from mandatory underfunded systems; questions applicability of PRO's research to mandatory context.\n\nCON's rebuttal is particularly strong in distinguishing voluntary vs. mandatory programs. Both engage well. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING:**\n\nPRO emphasizes long-term benefits (cognitive development, global competitiveness, inclusivity) but doesn't explicitly compare magnitude/probability against CON's concerns.\n\nCON explicitly weighs impacts in summary: \"practicality versus idealism\" framing, argues mandatory system would \"hinder English proficiency and academic rigor for all students\" (broader negative impact), emphasizes that PRO's benefits depend on well-resourced programs which wouldn't exist under mandate.\n\nCON provides clearer comparative weighing, explaining why their impacts (system-wide quality degradation) outweigh PRO's benefits (which depend on conditions unlikely under mandate). PRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nCON wins on weighing (4 vs 3) and ties on argument quality and clash. While PRO has slightly better evidence, CON's critical distinction between voluntary well-resourced programs and mandatory underfunded systems is a key analytical point that PRO never fully resolves. CON's weighing argument that PRO's benefits require conditions incompatible with a mandate is compelling and largely unaddressed by PRO in final speeches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing, effectively distinguishing voluntary well-resourced programs from mandatory underfunded systems.
