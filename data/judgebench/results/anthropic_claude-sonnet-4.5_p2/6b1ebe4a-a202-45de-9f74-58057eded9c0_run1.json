  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents three clear pillars: future job skills, cognitive development, and creativity. Arguments are well-structured and internally consistent throughout.\n\nCON presents three counter-arguments: curriculum overload, developmental appropriateness, and educational inequality. These are logically coherent and directly challenge PRO's framework.\n\nBoth sides maintain clarity. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING:**\n\nPRO cites Bureau of Labor Statistics (13% job growth), University of California study on logical reasoning, and references Finland/Singapore education systems. Uses ScratchJr as concrete example.\n\nCON relies more on logical reasoning about resource constraints and developmental psychology but provides less specific evidence. Arguments are grounded in educational theory but lack cited sources.\n\nPRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION:**\n\nPRO directly addresses all three CON arguments: curriculum overload (interdisciplinary approach), developmental concerns (ScratchJr example), and inequality (government support can bridge divide).\n\nCON effectively rebuts PRO's responses: distinguishes between \"mandatory\" vs. enhancement, differentiates ScratchJr from formal programming, challenges lack of concrete resource plans. CON's rebuttal is particularly strong in exposing gaps in PRO's implementation strategy.\n\nPRO: 4, CON: 5\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING:**\n\nPRO emphasizes future employability, cognitive benefits across disciplines, and creativity. However, doesn't explicitly compare why these outweigh CON's concerns about immediate educational harm.\n\nCON consistently weighs impacts: argues that immediate harm to holistic education and inequality outweigh speculative future benefits. Explicitly challenges PRO's \"idealistic\" claims and emphasizes practical implementation failures.\n\nPRO: 3, CON: 4\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nCON wins on clash (5 vs 4) and weighing (4 vs 3). While PRO has slightly better evidence, CON's superior engagement with opponent arguments and clearer comparative weighing (practical harms vs. theoretical benefits) proves decisive. CON effectively exposes that PRO's solution lacks concrete implementation plans, making the inequality concern particularly damaging. The distinction between computational thinking tools and formal programming is a key concession PRO never adequately addresses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 5\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior clash and impact weighing.
