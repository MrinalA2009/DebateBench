  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\nPRO: Presents clear, structured arguments about convenience, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized. Score: 4\nCON: Delivers well-structured arguments about diagnostic accuracy, personal connection, and health disparities. Arguments are clear and internally consistent. Score: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\nPRO: Cites American Telemedicine Association (75% satisfaction), National Institute of Health (30% cost reduction), and Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare. Evidence is specific and integrated. Score: 4\nCON: References Journal of the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association. Evidence supports claims but is slightly less specific in quantification. Score: 4\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\nPRO: Directly addresses physical examination concerns by distinguishing routine vs. complex visits. Responds to personal connection argument with counter-evidence. Acknowledges digital divide but offers mitigation strategy. Score: 4\nCON: Engages with PRO's convenience argument but maintains focus on own case. Reiterates core arguments rather than deeply engaging with PRO's distinction between routine and complex visits. Score: 3\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\nPRO: Explicitly weighs accessibility, cost reduction, and patient outcomes. Frames telemedicine as supplementary rather than complete replacement, which moderates the resolution but provides nuance. Score: 3\nCON: Emphasizes diagnostic accuracy and equity concerns but provides limited comparative weighing against PRO's cost and accessibility benefits. Doesn't directly compare magnitude of impacts. Score: 3\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS**\nThe key clash centers on whether routine visits require physical examination. PRO effectively distinguishes between routine (follow-ups, medication management) and complex cases, while CON maintains that many routine visits still need physical assessment. PRO's concession that telemedicine should \"supplement\" rather than \"replace most\" visits somewhat undermines the resolution but shows strategic nuance. CON's digital divide argument is significant but not weighed against PRO's cost savings and accessibility gains for those with technology access.\n\nPRO edges ahead primarily on clash - they more directly engaged CON's arguments and provided specific rebuttals, while CON largely restated their case without addressing PRO's key distinction about types of routine visits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.6,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on superior clash and refutation. While both sides presented quality arguments with evidence, PRO more effectively engaged CON's concerns by distinguishing routine from complex visits and providing counter-evidence on personal connection. CON's digital divide argument was significant but not comparatively weighed against PRO's accessibility and cost benefits. The debate was close on most metrics, with clash being the decisive factor.\"\n}\n```",
