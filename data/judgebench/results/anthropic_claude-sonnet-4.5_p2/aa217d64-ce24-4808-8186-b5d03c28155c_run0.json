  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\nPRO presents clear arguments centered on restorative justice principles, victim closure, and holistic justice. The structure is logical and internally consistent throughout.\nCON presents equally clear arguments about consistency, objectivity, and systemic integrity. Both sides maintain coherent positions.\nScore: PRO 4, CON 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\nPRO references \"studies\" showing victim satisfaction and closure, mentions victim impact statements as existing tools, and cites reduced recidivism in restorative justice programs. However, these remain somewhat generic.\nCON relies more on logical reasoning about judicial training, legal principles, and systemic concerns. Less empirical grounding but strong logical framework.\nScore: PRO 4, CON 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\nPRO directly addresses CON's consistency concerns by pointing to successful existing programs, refutes the \"innocent until proven guilty\" argument by clarifying the post-conviction timing, and responds to rehabilitation concerns.\nCON engages with PRO's structured programs claim, challenges the \"innocent until proven guilty\" response, and addresses the restorative justice benefits. Both sides engage substantively.\nScore: PRO 4, CON 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\nPRO explicitly weighs impacts in the summary: \"benefits of victim involvement far outweigh the potential drawbacks,\" emphasizes healing/reparation vs. punishment, and frames victim satisfaction and reduced recidivism as key outcomes.\nCON weighs systemic integrity and fairness as foundational principles that must be prioritized over individual satisfaction, but provides less explicit comparative weighing of magnitude/probability.\nScore: PRO 4, CON 3\n\n**OVERALL ANALYSIS**\nPRO maintains consistent engagement, provides more empirical grounding (though generic), and offers clearer comparative weighing in the final speech. CON presents strong principled arguments but relies more heavily on logical assertions without empirical support and provides less explicit impact comparison. The debate is close, but PRO's superior evidence grounding and clearer weighing framework provide the edge.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on superior evidence grounding and clearer impact weighing. While both sides clashed effectively, PRO provided empirical support for restorative justice benefits and explicitly compared impacts in the summary. CON's principled arguments about systemic integrity were strong but lacked comparative weighing and empirical grounding, making PRO's case more compelling on balance.\"\n}\n```",
