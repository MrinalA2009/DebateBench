  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY**\nPRO presents clear arguments: aviation emissions contribute to climate change (2.5% of global emissions, projected to triple), rationing reduces emissions directly, and equity concerns favor rationing. The logic is straightforward and internally consistent.\n\nCON presents equally clear counter-arguments: economic damage, job losses, restriction of freedoms, inequity of carbon pricing favoring the wealthy, and technological alternatives. The structure is coherent and well-organized.\n\nBoth sides: 4/5\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING**\nPRO provides specific data (2.5% of emissions, projection to triple by 2050) and mechanisms (carbon pricing generating revenue for sustainable tech). However, evidence for implementation feasibility is limited.\n\nCON provides concrete examples (Airbus hydrogen aircraft, SAF production increasing) and specific mechanisms showing how alternatives work. The grounding in real-world economic impacts is stronger.\n\nPRO: 3/5, CON: 4/5\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION**\nPRO directly engages CON's economic concerns by arguing long-term climate costs outweigh short-term economic benefits. They address the equity critique and the technology timeline issue.\n\nCON systematically refutes PRO's equity claim by explaining how carbon pricing creates a two-tiered system. They directly challenge the \"urgency\" argument by showing current technological progress. CON's engagement is more thorough and specific.\n\nPRO: 3/5, CON: 4/5\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING**\nPRO attempts weighing by comparing long-term climate costs to short-term economic impacts, but doesn't quantify or deeply compare magnitude/probability.\n\nCON provides clearer comparative weighing: \"maximum economic pain for minimal environmental gain,\" noting aviation is a small percentage of emissions compared to other sectors. They explicitly compare the disproportionate harm of rationing versus the benefits of technological solutions.\n\nPRO: 3/5, CON: 4/5\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**\nCON wins on three of four criteria. Most critically, CON's impact weighing is superior\u2014they effectively argue that rationing causes disproportionate economic harm relative to environmental benefit, while technological solutions offer decarbonization without these costs. CON also better addresses the equity concern by showing how carbon pricing would actually worsen inequality, directly turning PRO's argument. PRO's urgency argument is weakened by CON's evidence of current technological progress.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing, demonstrating rationing causes disproportionate economic harm for minimal environmental gain given aviation's small emissions share.
