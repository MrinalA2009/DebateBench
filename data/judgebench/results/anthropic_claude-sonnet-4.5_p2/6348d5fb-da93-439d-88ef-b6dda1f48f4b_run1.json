  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically across all four criteria, then determine the winner.\n\n**ARGUMENT QUALITY ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO presents clear, structured arguments: youth already have responsibilities, lowering voting age increases engagement, youth are informed, and equality principles support the change. Arguments are logically coherent and well-organized.\n\nCON counters with: maturity concerns, lack of civic education infrastructure, and susceptibility to manipulation. Arguments are also clear and logically structured, though somewhat more defensive in nature.\n\nBoth sides maintain internal consistency. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**EVIDENCE & GROUNDING ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO cites: Austria and Scotland as examples, references to studies showing younger voters are engaged/informed, mentions cognitive development research. Evidence is somewhat general but relevant.\n\nCON points to: differences in civic education systems between countries, complexity of electoral issues, and digital manipulation concerns. Also somewhat general but grounded in practical concerns.\n\nBoth provide moderate support for claims. PRO: 3, CON: 3\n\n**CLASH & REFUTATION ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO directly engages CON's maturity argument, addresses the civic education concern by proposing simultaneous improvement, and turns the misinformation argument to apply to all ages.\n\nCON directly refutes PRO's maturity claims, challenges the applicability of international examples, and argues against the \"cart before horse\" approach of voting before education.\n\nBoth sides engage substantively with opponent's arguments. PRO: 4, CON: 4\n\n**IMPACT WEIGHING ANALYSIS:**\n\nPRO emphasizes: empowerment of youth on issues affecting their futures (education, climate), cultivation of lifelong voters, democratic inclusivity and equality.\n\nCON emphasizes: electoral integrity, informed participation, risks of manipulation outweighing benefits.\n\nPRO provides clearer comparative weighing by explaining why youth engagement on future-affecting issues matters and connecting to democratic principles. CON focuses more on risk mitigation but doesn't as clearly weigh why their impacts outweigh PRO's benefits. PRO: 4, CON: 3\n\n**WINNER DETERMINATION:**\n\nThis is a close debate with strong performance from both sides. The key differentiator is impact weighing. PRO more effectively explains why their impacts (youth voice on future-affecting issues, democratic equality) should be prioritized, while CON focuses primarily on defending against risks without clearly establishing why those risks outweigh PRO's benefits. PRO's turn on the misinformation argument (applying to all ages) also weakens CON's impact calculus.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on superior impact weighing.
