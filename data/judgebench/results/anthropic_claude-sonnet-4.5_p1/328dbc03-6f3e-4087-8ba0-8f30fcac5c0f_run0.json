  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Public health crisis (obesity, sleep deprivation, developmental delays) - Supported with AAP guidelines and JAMA Pediatrics study\n2. Legal precedent exists (car seats, vaccinations) for limiting parental autonomy when child welfare is at stake\n3. Legal framework empowers parents against digital pressures\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Parental autonomy - parents best understand individual children's needs\n2. Not all screen time is harmful - educational content provides benefits (Joan Ganz Cooney Center study)\n3. Legal mandates could damage parent-child relationships\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO effectively countered the \"not all screen time is equal\" argument by clarifying the resolution calls for limits, not bans\n- CON's rebuttal that car seat/vaccination comparisons are \"misleading\" was asserted but not fully developed - they claimed screen time is \"more nuanced\" without explaining why this difference matters\n- PRO's argument about empowering parents was challenged by CON as \"speculative,\" but CON's counter-claim about fostering resentment was equally speculative\n- CON never directly addressed PRO's specific health data (JAMA study, AAP recommendations)\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's Impact:** Widespread, measurable health harms affecting an entire generation - obesity, developmental delays, cognitive impairment. High magnitude, high probability (supported by studies).\n\n**CON's Impact:** Loss of parental autonomy and potential relationship damage. Moderate magnitude, speculative probability (no evidence provided for relationship harm).\n\nPRO provided concrete evidence of current harms, while CON's impacts were largely hypothetical. PRO also established legal precedent showing autonomy can be limited for child welfare.\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear structure, logical progression, well-defined position)\n- CON: 4 (Clear structure, coherent arguments about autonomy)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 4 (AAP guidelines, JAMA study, NIH research, specific data points)\n- CON: 3 (Joan Ganz Cooney study mentioned but less integrated; relationship claims unsupported)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 4 (Directly engaged CON's autonomy argument, addressed \"not all screen time equal\" claim, responded to relationship concerns)\n- CON: 3 (Engaged some arguments but dropped the health data, didn't adequately distinguish car seat analogy)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear comparison: generation-wide health crisis vs. autonomy concerns; explained why state intervention justified)\n- CON: 2 (Asserted autonomy important but didn't weigh against health harms; no comparative analysis of magnitude)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won through superior impact weighing and evidence. While both sides presented clear arguments, PRO provided concrete health data that CON never adequately refuted, established legal precedent for limiting autonomy when child welfare is at stake, and effectively compared the magnitude of generation-wide health harms against speculative relationship concerns. CON's failure to engage with PRO's specific evidence and provide comparative weighing was decisive.\"\n}\n```",
