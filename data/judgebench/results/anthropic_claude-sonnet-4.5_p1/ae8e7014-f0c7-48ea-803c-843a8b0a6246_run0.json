  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Aviation contributes 2.5% of global emissions, projected to triple by 2050\n2. Rationing through carbon pricing reduces demand and generates revenue for sustainable tech\n3. Current system is inequitable - benefits few, costs borne by all\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Rationing would devastate economies, especially developing nations dependent on tourism/trade\n2. Carbon pricing creates two-tiered system favoring wealthy (equity critique)\n3. Technological solutions (SAFs, electric aircraft, hydrogen) are actively being developed and offer decarbonization without economic damage\n\n**Key Clash Points:**\n- PRO argues urgency requires immediate action; CON counters that tech solutions are already progressing\n- PRO claims rationing promotes equity; CON effectively rebuts that carbon pricing makes travel exclusive to wealthy\n- CON's economic impact argument largely unrefuted by PRO beyond \"long-term costs of inaction\"\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\nCON more effectively undermined PRO's equity argument by showing carbon pricing creates regressive outcomes. PRO never adequately responded to the \"two-tiered system\" critique. CON's economic impact argument (job losses, developing nations harmed) remained largely standing, with PRO only offering general \"long-term costs of inaction\" without specific comparative weighing.\n\nPRO's urgency argument has merit but doesn't overcome CON's demonstration that: (1) aviation is small percentage of emissions, and (2) technological solutions are already in development, not distant futures.\n\nCON provided clearer impact weighing by comparing immediate economic devastation against minimal environmental gain from rationing one sector.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON won by effectively refuting PRO's equity claim, showing carbon pricing creates regressive two-tiered access. CON's economic impact arguments remained largely unrefuted, while providing clearer comparative weighing between immediate economic costs and minimal emissions reduction from one sector. PRO's urgency argument insufficient to overcome demonstrated inequity and disproportionate harm to developing nations.\"\n}\n```",
