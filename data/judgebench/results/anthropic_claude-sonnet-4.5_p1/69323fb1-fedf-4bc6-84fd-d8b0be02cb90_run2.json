  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Aviation emissions are projected to double/triple by 2050 (ICAO data)\n2. Rationing targets the 1% causing 50% of emissions (Global Environmental Change study)\n3. Technology solutions are decades away and insufficient\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Rationing would affect essential travelers (small businesses, medical professionals, family visits)\n2. Aviation industry is making progress on sustainable fuels and technology\n3. Rationing could shift emissions to other transport modes\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO effectively refuted CON's \"regressive\" claim by emphasizing the targeting of high-frequency flyers\n- CON's technology argument was weakened by PRO's point about timeline insufficiency\n- CON's \"essential travel\" argument persisted but was partially addressed by PRO's exemption claim\n- CON's modal shift argument remained largely unrefuted by PRO\n\n## Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's Impact:** Climate catastrophe from unchecked aviation growth (magnitude: existential; probability: high per ICAO projections; timeframe: 2050)\n\n**CON's Impact:** Economic disruption and inequitable access (magnitude: significant but localized; probability: uncertain; timeframe: immediate)\n\nPRO provided stronger quantitative grounding (1% causing 50%, doubling/tripling projections) while CON relied more on speculative concerns about essential travel without quantifying how many would be affected.\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear, structured, consistent framing around equity and urgency)\n- CON: 3 (Coherent but less focused; mixed essential travel with technology arguments)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 5 (ICAO projections, Global Environmental Change study, specific percentages)\n- CON: 3 (Generic references to technology development without specific data)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 4 (Directly addressed regressive claim and technology timeline)\n- CON: 3 (Engaged but didn't effectively counter PRO's core evidence)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear comparison: climate catastrophe vs. inconvenience; magnitude and timeframe)\n- CON: 2 (Mentioned consequences but didn't comparatively weigh against climate impacts)\n\nPRO's strongest surviving argument is that rationing targets the disproportionate 1% while technology is insufficient for the 2050 timeline. CON's strongest surviving argument is potential disruption to essential travelers, but this was weakened by PRO's exemption claim and lack of quantification.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won through superior evidence grounding (ICAO projections, 1% causing 50% statistic) and effective impact weighing comparing climate catastrophe to travel inconvenience.
