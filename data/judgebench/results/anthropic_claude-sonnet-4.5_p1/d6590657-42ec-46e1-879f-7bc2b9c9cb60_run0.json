  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Common heritage preservation (Outer Space Treaty)\n2. Conflict prevention (territorial disputes lead to war)\n3. Scientific collaboration (ISS example)\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Ownership incentivizes investment/innovation\n2. Resource security for human survival\n3. Facilitates human expansion into space\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO argues ownership leads to monopolization; CON responds that regulated frameworks can prevent this\n- PRO claims ownership causes conflict; CON counters that international legal frameworks can govern property rights\n- PRO points to ISS as collaborative success; CON distinguishes government-funded missions from self-sustaining economic models\n- CON argues common heritage has led to stagnation; PRO doesn't directly refute this empirical claim\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n- **PRO**: Conflict prevention argument remains, but weakened by CON's legal framework response\n- **CON**: Economic incentive argument stands relatively unrefuted - PRO doesn't address why collaboration alone would generate necessary capital for large-scale development\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- CON explicitly weighs resource depletion and human survival as existential concerns\n- PRO weighs conflict prevention but doesn't compare magnitude against CON's survival framing\n- CON distinguishes between short-term scientific missions vs. long-term settlement economics\n- PRO relies heavily on ISS example but doesn't address CON's point about self-sustaining models\n\n## Scoring Assessment\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure, coherent claims (4)\n- CON: Well-developed economic framework, clear distinctions (4)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Outer Space Treaty, ISS example (3)\n- CON: Uses economic reasoning, addresses stagnation empirically (4)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Engages CON's points but responses are somewhat generic (3)\n- CON: Directly addresses PRO's monopolization and conflict concerns with specific counterarguments (4)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Mentions conflict and inequality but limited comparative analysis (2)\n- CON: Explicitly compares stagnation vs. progress, survival concerns, distinguishes mission types (4)\n\nCON more effectively engaged with PRO's arguments, provided comparative weighing between stagnation and progress, and PRO's conflict prevention argument was weakened by CON's legal framework response without adequate defense.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior impact weighing and clash.
