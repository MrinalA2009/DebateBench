  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Bilingual education promotes inclusivity (21% speak non-English at home)\n2. Enhances cognitive development (research shows improved problem-solving, creativity)\n3. Prepares students for global economy (job postings requiring bilingual skills doubled)\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Insurmountable logistical/financial challenges (350+ languages, teacher shortage)\n2. Dilutes educational quality (resources spread thin, hinders English proficiency)\n3. Infringes on local control and parental choice\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO responds to logistics by suggesting focus on \"most prevalent languages\" and citing existing successful programs\n- CON effectively counters that even \"most prevalent\" languages would require impossible resources, and that PRO's research is based on voluntary, well-resourced programs, not mandatory systems\n- PRO claims bilingual students outperform peers, but CON points out this is from voluntary programs\n- PRO's \"long-term savings\" claim is countered by CON's argument about complete system overhaul costs\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Key Distinction:** CON successfully establishes that PRO's evidence comes from voluntary, well-resourced programs, not mandatory systems. This is a critical distinction that PRO never adequately addresses.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO focuses on benefits but doesn't weigh against implementation costs\n- CON emphasizes magnitude of logistical challenges (350+ languages, existing teacher shortage) and probability of failure (mandatory vs. voluntary programs)\n- CON's argument about diluted quality affecting ALL students has broader scope than PRO's benefits\n\n**Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n- PRO: Cognitive benefits and global competitiveness (but weakened by voluntary vs. mandatory distinction)\n- CON: Logistical impossibility and quality dilution (remains largely unrefuted)\n\nCON wins the comparative because they successfully demonstrate that PRO's evidence doesn't support a MANDATORY system, and the practical barriers remain unaddressed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by successfully distinguishing voluntary bilingual programs from mandatory systems, demonstrating PRO's evidence doesn't support their mandate. CON's logistical challenges (350+ languages, teacher shortage) remain largely unrefuted, while their argument that mandatory implementation would dilute quality for all students outweighs PRO's benefits. CON provided superior impact weighing by emphasizing probability and magnitude of implementation failure.\"\n}\n```",
