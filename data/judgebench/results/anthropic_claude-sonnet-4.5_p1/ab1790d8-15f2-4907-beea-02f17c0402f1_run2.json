  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Core Arguments:**\n1. Deep-sea mining threatens unique ecosystems (90% species loss claim from NOAA)\n2. Mining releases toxic chemicals and sediment\n3. Alternative sources exist (recycling, waste reduction)\n\n**CON's Core Arguments:**\n1. Deep-sea minerals essential for renewable energy transition (IEA projection of 4x demand by 2040)\n2. Regulatory frameworks (ISA) and technology can mitigate impacts\n3. Terrestrial mining has worse environmental/social costs\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO claims alternatives exist; CON responds that recycling alone cannot meet volume demands and that PRO's own source confirms primary extraction remains necessary\n- PRO attacks ISA framework as \"in its infancy\"; CON counters with years of dedicated work and specific mechanisms (EIAs, protected areas)\n- PRO emphasizes ecosystem fragility; CON acknowledges but argues terrestrial alternatives are worse\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's strongest remaining argument:** Deep-sea ecosystems are unique and fragile, with high risk of species loss.\n\n**CON's strongest remaining argument:** Deep-sea minerals are necessary for renewable energy transition; prohibition forces reliance on worse terrestrial alternatives.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- CON provides specific magnitude (4x mineral demand by 2040) and timeframe\n- CON directly engages PRO's alternative sources claim, pointing out that PRO's own cited report confirms primary extraction remains necessary\n- PRO's ecosystem impact claim (90% species loss) is significant but not comparatively weighed against climate change impacts from hindered renewable transition\n- CON frames the choice as between two imperfect options, while PRO presents prohibition as absolute without adequately addressing mineral demand\n\n## Scoring Assessment\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 3 (Clear position but relies on absolute prohibition without fully addressing demand concerns)\n- CON: 4 (Coherent framework balancing necessity with regulation)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 3 (NOAA report cited, European Commission report mentioned but CON challenges its interpretation)\n- CON: 4 (IEA projections, ISA framework details, specific minerals and technologies named)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 3 (Engages CON's arguments but doesn't adequately respond to demand/scale concerns)\n- CON: 4 (Directly addresses PRO's alternatives claim, challenges interpretation of PRO's own evidence)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 2 (Emphasizes ecosystem risks but minimal comparative weighing against CON's impacts)\n- CON: 4 (Clear comparative framework: climate change vs. ecosystem disruption, terrestrial vs. deep-sea impacts)\n\nCON more effectively engaged with PRO's evidence, provided comparative weighing between competing harms, and addressed the scalability question that PRO left largely unanswered.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON won through superior impact weighing and clash.
