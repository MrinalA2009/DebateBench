  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Core Arguments:**\n1. Nationalism creates \"us vs them\" mentality leading to marginalization\n2. Historical evidence (WWI, WWII) shows destructive consequences\n3. Recent examples (America First, Brexit) demonstrate xenophobic outcomes\n4. Nationalism undermines global cooperation (climate crisis example)\n\n**CON's Core Arguments:**\n1. Nationalism fosters identity and belonging, promoting social cohesion\n2. Nationalism enhances democratic governance through civic engagement\n3. Nationalism can coexist with global cooperation\n4. Canada as example of inclusive nationalism with multiculturalism\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO directly challenges CON's unity claim by arguing it comes through exclusion\n- PRO contests the democratic governance claim, arguing nationalism undermines institutions\n- PRO refutes coexistence with global cooperation using climate crisis\n- CON responds with Canada example but doesn't adequately address PRO's historical evidence\n- CON doesn't effectively counter PRO's specific examples (Brexit, America First)\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's strongest remaining argument:** Nationalism's track record of creating division and undermining cooperation, supported by historical and contemporary examples.\n\n**CON's strongest remaining argument:** Responsible nationalism can foster unity and civic engagement, with Canada as a counterexample.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO provides concrete examples with clear negative impacts (world wars, hate crimes, climate inaction)\n- CON's impacts are more theoretical and rely on the \"responsible nationalism\" qualifier\n- PRO's timeframe is both historical and immediate\n- CON's Canada example is a single case that doesn't address PRO's broader evidence\n\n## Scoring\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear, logical progression from premise to examples)\n- CON: 3 (Coherent but relies heavily on \"responsible nationalism\" qualifier)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 4 (Multiple historical and contemporary examples)\n- CON: 3 (Canada example provided but limited comparative evidence)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 4 (Directly engages each CON argument with specific refutations)\n- CON: 3 (Responds to PRO but doesn't adequately address historical evidence)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear magnitude comparison: world wars, climate crisis vs. civic engagement)\n- CON: 2 (Limited comparative weighing, mostly asserts benefits without comparing to harms)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior impact weighing and evidence. While CON presents the Canada counterexample, PRO's historical evidence (world wars) and contemporary examples (Brexit, climate inaction) demonstrate greater magnitude and scope of harm. CON's reliance on 'responsible nationalism' as a qualifier weakens their position, as PRO effectively argues this is the exception rather than the rule. PRO's direct refutation of each CON argument and clearer comparative weighing proved decisive.\"\n}\n```",
