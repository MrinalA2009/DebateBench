  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n**Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis:**\n\nPRO's main arguments:\n1. Victim empowerment and dignity - partially challenged but survives\n2. More informed sentencing decisions - challenged on bias grounds but defended\n3. Enhanced public trust - dropped by CON, survives unchallenged\n4. Promotes rehabilitation through accountability - contested but defended\n\nCON's main arguments:\n1. Risk of inconsistent/biased outcomes - acknowledged by PRO but reframed\n2. Could compromise rehabilitation - directly refuted by PRO with counter-evidence\n3. Emotional trauma to victims - PRO conceded possibility but offered mitigation\n\n**Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO's strongest surviving argument: Enhanced public trust (completely dropped by CON) combined with informed sentencing decisions.\n\nCON's strongest surviving argument: Risk of bias and inconsistent outcomes based on emotional investment of victims.\n\n**Scoring Analysis:**\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure, consistent logic throughout (4)\n- CON: Well-structured but relies heavily on hypothetical risks (4)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: References research on victim satisfaction and rehabilitation, provides mechanisms (4)\n- CON: Makes claims about research but less specific, more assertion-based (3)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages all CON arguments, provides counter-evidence (4)\n- CON: Engages PRO arguments but drops the public trust claim entirely (3)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Compares benefits (empowerment, informed decisions, trust) against risks, argues benefits outweigh (4)\n- CON: Focuses on risks but doesn't adequately weigh against PRO's dropped public trust argument (3)\n\n**Critical Factor:** CON completely dropped PRO's public trust argument, which PRO extended through both rebuttal and summary. This is a significant concession in competitive debate. Additionally, PRO provided more specific mechanisms for how victim input improves outcomes, while CON relied more on hypothetical concerns without addressing PRO's mitigation strategies.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior clash and weighing.
