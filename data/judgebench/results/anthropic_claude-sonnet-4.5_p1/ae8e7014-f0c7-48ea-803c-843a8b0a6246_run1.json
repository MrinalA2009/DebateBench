  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Aviation contributes 2.5% of global emissions, projected to triple by 2050\n2. Rationing through carbon pricing reduces demand and generates revenue for sustainable tech\n3. Current system is inequitable - benefits few, costs borne by all\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Rationing would devastate economies, especially developing nations dependent on tourism/trade\n2. Technological solutions (SAFs, electric aircraft, hydrogen) are actively being developed\n3. Carbon pricing creates two-tiered system favoring wealthy, worsening inequality\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- CON effectively challenged PRO's equity claim by pointing out carbon pricing makes travel a luxury for the wealthy\n- PRO's response that tech solutions are \"long-term\" was countered by CON showing active development\n- CON's economic impact argument (job losses, trade disruption) was not adequately refuted by PRO\n- PRO's climate urgency argument was not directly refuted but CON reframed it as needing \"effective\" not \"any\" action\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's surviving impact:** Climate mitigation through immediate emissions reduction\n**CON's surviving impact:** Economic devastation and worsened inequality\n\nCON more effectively demonstrated that PRO's solution creates the very inequity PRO claims to solve. PRO failed to adequately defend against the \"wealthy-only access\" critique. CON's technological alternative provides a mechanism for emissions reduction without the economic costs, which PRO dismissed but didn't refute substantively.\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:** CON presented more internally consistent arguments, particularly exposing the contradiction in PRO's equity claims. PRO 3, CON 4.\n\n**Evidence:** Both sides used general claims. CON provided specific examples (Airbus hydrogen aircraft, SAF production). PRO 3, CON 4.\n\n**Clash:** CON directly engaged PRO's equity and urgency claims effectively. PRO engaged but less effectively on economic impacts. PRO 3, CON 4.\n\n**Weighing:** CON better compared economic devastation vs. minimal environmental gain from aviation's 2.5% share. PRO asserted urgency but didn't comparatively weigh. PRO 2, CON 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON won by effectively turning PRO's equity argument, demonstrating carbon pricing creates wealthy-only access rather than equity.
