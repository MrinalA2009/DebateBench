  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Accessibility (50% increase in access for remote areas)\n2. Efficiency (half the time for consultations)\n3. Patient satisfaction (76% satisfaction rate)\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Diagnostic accuracy concerns (misdiagnosis risk, 75% diagnoses require physical exam)\n2. Patient-doctor relationship quality\n3. Comprehensive care limitations\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO responds to diagnostic accuracy by limiting scope to \"routine consultations where physical examinations are not critical\" and mentions AI tools\n- CON counters that 75% of diagnoses require physical examination, directly challenging PRO's limitation\n- PRO argues telemedicine \"complements\" rather than replaces, but this contradicts the resolution's \"replace most\"\n- CON effectively points out this contradiction in their rebuttal\n\n## Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's strongest remaining argument:** Accessibility gains for underserved populations (50% increase)\n\n**CON's strongest remaining argument:** Diagnostic accuracy concerns (75% of diagnoses require physical examination)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO emphasizes magnitude (millions gaining access) but doesn't weigh against diagnostic risks\n- CON weighs quality vs. convenience trade-off explicitly, arguing misdiagnosis risks outweigh convenience\n- CON's 75% statistic directly undermines PRO's claim that telemedicine works for \"most\" routine visits\n- PRO's retreat to \"complement not replace\" contradicts the resolution\n\n## Scoring Assessment\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure but internal contradiction (complement vs. replace) - 3\n- CON: Consistent position, clear trade-off framing - 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Specific statistics (50%, 76%, half the time) - 4\n- CON: Specific statistics (75% diagnosis stat) and journal citations - 4\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Addresses concerns but shifts position - 3\n- CON: Directly engages PRO's claims and exposes contradictions - 4\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Lists benefits but minimal comparative weighing - 2\n- CON: Explicit quality vs. convenience trade-off, prioritization clear - 4\n\nCON wins because they effectively challenged PRO's core premise (that telemedicine can handle \"most\" routine visits) with the 75% physical examination statistic, maintained consistency with the resolution's burden, and provided clearer impact weighing on the quality-convenience trade-off.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by effectively challenging PRO's core claim with the 75% physical examination statistic, exposing PRO's contradiction between 'replace most' and 'complement,' and providing superior impact weighing on quality versus convenience trade-offs.
