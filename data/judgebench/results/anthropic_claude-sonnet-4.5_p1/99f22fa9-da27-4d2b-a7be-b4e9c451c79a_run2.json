  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Autonomy principle - terminally ill patients should control their own end-of-life decisions\n2. Evidence from Oregon/Switzerland showing no significant coercion or erosion of trust\n3. Assisted suicide and palliative care can be complementary\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Risk of coercion and \"duty to die\" pressure on vulnerable populations\n2. Fundamental ethical shift in medicine from healing to facilitating death\n3. Safeguards insufficient to detect subtle pressures\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO responds to coercion concerns with safeguards and Oregon data\n- CON counters that safeguards cannot detect subtle pressures and Oregon data doesn't capture nuanced coercion\n- PRO claims complementarity of palliative care and assisted suicide\n- CON argues these are fundamentally opposed goals (alleviating suffering vs. ending life)\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's Impact:** Individual autonomy and dignity for terminally ill patients, supported by empirical evidence from jurisdictions with legalized assisted suicide\n\n**CON's Impact:** Protection of vulnerable populations from coercion, preservation of medical ethics and doctor-patient trust\n\n**Key Differentiator:** CON effectively challenges PRO's empirical claims by arguing that absence of reported coercion doesn't mean absence of subtle pressure. However, PRO provides concrete evidence (Oregon, Switzerland) while CON relies primarily on theoretical risks. CON's argument about the fundamental ethical shift in medicine remains largely unrefuted - PRO doesn't adequately address how doctors can maintain their healing role while prescribing lethal medication.\n\n**Weighing:** CON provides clearer comparative weighing in their summary, explicitly framing the choice between offering death versus comprehensive care. PRO focuses on benefits but doesn't directly weigh against CON's harms. CON's \"duty to die\" framing is particularly compelling and not fully answered by PRO's safeguard arguments.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior clash and weighing.
