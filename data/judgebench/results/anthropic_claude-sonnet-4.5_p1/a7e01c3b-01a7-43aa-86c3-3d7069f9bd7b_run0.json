  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Environmental impact (5-14x more polluting than commercial, 50x more than trains)\n2. Social inequity and resource misallocation\n3. Immediate action needed vs. waiting for future tech\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Economic impact (jobs, revenue, related industries)\n2. Essential functions (medical, humanitarian)\n3. Innovation potential in green aviation tech\n\n**After Clash:**\n- PRO effectively refutes CON's economic argument by noting resource reallocation could create more jobs in sustainable infrastructure\n- PRO successfully challenges the \"essential functions\" claim as exceptions, not the rule\n- PRO directly attacks CON's reliance on future technology as \"dangerous deferral\"\n- CON's rebuttal oddly concedes PRO's economic point (\"redirecting resources...can create far more jobs\") then contradicts this in summary\n- CON fails to defend against PRO's timeline argument about immediate action\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n- PRO: Environmental urgency + immediate action needed (well-defended, specific data)\n- CON: Economic/jobs concern (weakened by own concession in rebuttal)\n\nPRO's environmental argument with specific pollution data (5-14x, 50x multipliers) remains largely uncontested. CON never disputes these figures or their significance. PRO's weighing on timeline (immediate crisis vs. future solutions) is explicit and unrefuted.\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear, logical, consistent throughout)\n- CON: 3 (Self-contradictory in rebuttal, less coherent)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 4 (Specific 2023 Transport & Environment report, concrete multipliers)\n- CON: 2 (Generic claims about \"billions\" and \"hundreds of thousands\" without sources)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 4 (Directly engages all CON arguments, labels them as \"red herring\" and \"exaggeration\")\n- CON: 2 (Rebuttal actually concedes PRO's economic point, minimal engagement with environmental data)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 4 (Explicit timeline weighing, magnitude comparison, \"planet burns\" urgency)\n- CON: 2 (Mentions impacts but no comparative weighing against PRO's environmental claims)\n\nCON's critical error in rebuttal (conceding the economic argument then reasserting it in summary) significantly undermines their position. PRO maintains consistency and directly weighs their impacts as more urgent.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively through superior evidence (specific pollution data), effective refutation of CON's economic and essential functions claims, and clear impact weighing on timeline urgency.
