  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n- Cultural commodification occurs when tourism becomes dominant (Maasai example)\n- The \"right to restrict\" enables sustainable practices and empowered management\n- Japan and Bhutan examples actually support PRO's case as they use restrictions\n\n**CON's Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n- Economic benefits of tourism support cultural preservation through funding\n- Sustainable tourism practices can balance preservation with access\n- Restrictions raise concerns about discrimination and who decides authenticity\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Key Clash Points:**\n1. PRO effectively turned CON's Japan/Bhutan examples, arguing these nations use restrictions to achieve sustainability\n2. CON's economic argument was partially undermined by PRO's point about cultural costs and dependency\n3. CON's discrimination concern was addressed by PRO as a \"red herring\" but not fully refuted\n4. PRO maintained focus on sovereignty and the right to implement measures, while CON focused on alternatives to restrictions\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO emphasized cultural erosion as irreversible and fundamental to national sovereignty\n- CON emphasized economic harm and potential human rights violations\n- PRO's framing of \"right to restrict\" as enabling (not mandating) restrictions was strategically effective\n- CON's alternative solutions (education, sustainable practices) didn't directly negate the need for the right itself\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear, consistent framing around sovereignty and the right to implement measures (4)\n- CON: Coherent but conflated \"right to restrict\" with \"mandatory restrictions\" (3)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Specific examples (Maasai, Venice) with mechanisms explained (4)\n- CON: General references but less specific mechanisms (3)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engaged CON's examples and turned them; addressed economic argument (4)\n- CON: Engaged but didn't effectively counter PRO's sovereignty framing (3)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clear weighing of cultural preservation as fundamental and irreversible (4)\n- CON: Some weighing but less comparative analysis (3)\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nPRO maintained a clearer through-line about sovereignty and successfully reframed CON's examples as supporting their case. The key strategic advantage was distinguishing between having the \"right to restrict\" versus mandatory restrictions, which CON never effectively addressed. PRO's turn of the Japan/Bhutan examples was particularly effective.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won by maintaining consistent focus on sovereignty and the right to implement protective measures, effectively turning CON's sustainable tourism examples (Japan, Bhutan) as evidence that restrictions enable preservation.
