  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Restorative justice benefits - victims gain closure and satisfaction\n2. Victim impact statements provide valuable context without compromising guilt determination\n3. Evidence of reduced recidivism through restorative approaches\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Victim involvement leads to inconsistent, emotionally-driven sentences\n2. Compromises judicial objectivity and impartiality\n3. Shifts focus from systemic goals (deterrence, rehabilitation) to individual grievances\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO argues structured programs prevent inconsistency; CON responds that emotional weight still influences judges despite guidelines\n- PRO claims sentencing occurs post-guilt; CON counters that fairness principles still apply at sentencing\n- PRO emphasizes victim healing; CON prioritizes systemic integrity\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO focuses on victim satisfaction and healing (individual-level impacts)\n- CON focuses on systemic integrity and fairness (systemic-level impacts)\n\nCON more effectively weighs impacts by arguing that compromising judicial objectivity affects ALL cases system-wide, while PRO's benefits are case-specific. CON's argument about inconsistent sentencing creating broader injustice has greater magnitude and scope than PRO's closure benefits.\n\n**Evidence Quality:**\nPRO references \"studies\" and \"empirical evidence\" but provides no specific data. CON relies more on logical reasoning about systemic principles. Both lack concrete evidence, but CON's logical framework is more developed.\n\n**Refutation Effectiveness:**\nCON directly addresses PRO's structured programs claim by arguing emotional influence persists regardless. PRO's response to the \"innocent until proven guilty\" concern is adequate but doesn't fully address CON's broader fairness argument.\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:** Both sides present coherent arguments. CON slightly edges with clearer systemic framework.\n\n**Evidence:** Both lack strong empirical support. PRO claims studies exist but doesn't cite them; CON relies on principle-based reasoning.\n\n**Clash:** CON more directly engages PRO's specific claims about structured programs and emotional influence.\n\n**Weighing:** CON provides superior comparative weighing by emphasizing systemic impacts over individual benefits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing, arguing systemic fairness and consistency affect all cases while PRO's victim satisfaction benefits are case-specific. CON more effectively refuted PRO's structured programs defense by showing emotional influence persists regardless of guidelines.
