  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Tipping creates wage instability (supported by One Fair Wage study showing 2x poverty rate)\n2. Tipping fosters discrimination and harassment (ROC United studies cited)\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Tipping incentivizes exceptional service (Cornell study cited)\n2. Tipping allows income flexibility\n3. Abolition would cause job losses and price increases\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO effectively refuted CON's \"flexibility\" argument by reframing it as instability\n- PRO challenged the service incentive claim by arguing it creates inconsistent service\n- CON's rebuttal largely echoed PRO's points rather than defending their own position\n- CON failed to defend against PRO's discrimination/harassment argument\n- Neither side provided strong defense of their evidence claims\n\n## Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Surviving Arguments:**\n- PRO: Wage instability and discrimination remain largely uncontested\n- CON: Service incentive argument weakened but not eliminated\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO explicitly weighs poverty rates (2x) and harassment impacts\n- CON provides limited comparative weighing, mostly asserting preferences\n- PRO's impacts (financial security, reduced harassment) are more concrete than CON's (service quality, worker preference)\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear, consistent structure with logical progression (4)\n- CON: Some internal contradictions in rebuttal where they echo PRO's points (3)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Specific studies cited with quantifiable claims (One Fair Wage, ROC United) (4)\n- CON: Studies mentioned but less specific application (Cornell, NRA) (3)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engaged CON's flexibility and service arguments (4)\n- CON: Rebuttal largely agreed with PRO rather than defending position (2)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clear comparative weighing (poverty rates, harassment vs. service quality) (4)\n- CON: Minimal comparative analysis, mostly assertions (2)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior clash and weighing.
