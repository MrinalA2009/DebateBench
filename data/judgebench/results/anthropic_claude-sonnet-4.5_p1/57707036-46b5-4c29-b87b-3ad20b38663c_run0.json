  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Nationalism fosters division (US/UK polarization, xenophobia)\n2. Nationalism enables authoritarianism (Orb\u00e1n in Hungary)\n3. Nationalism undermines global cooperation (COVID-19 response)\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Nationalism can unify nations (post-WWII US civil rights)\n2. Nationalism supports democratic sovereignty (doesn't inherently lead to authoritarianism)\n3. Nationalism can coexist with global cooperation (EU example)\n\n**After Clash:**\n- PRO effectively countered CON's post-WWII example by citing McCarthyism\n- CON acknowledged manipulation of nationalism but argued it's not inherent to nationalism itself\n- PRO's COVID-19 example remained largely unrefuted\n- CON's EU example remained largely unrefuted\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\nPRO's strongest surviving argument: Nationalism's practical manifestation in modern politics leads to division and authoritarianism (Orb\u00e1n, xenophobia, COVID-19 hoarding).\n\nCON's strongest surviving argument: Nationalism isn't inherently destructive; its impact depends on implementation and can support democratic values (EU example).\n\n**Critical Distinction:** PRO focused on empirical examples of nationalism's destructive effects in practice. CON argued about nationalism's theoretical potential when \"properly practiced.\"\n\nPRO provided more concrete, contemporary examples (Orb\u00e1n, COVID-19, US/UK polarization). CON's EU example was less developed and the post-WWII example was effectively challenged.\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:** PRO presented clearer, more structured claims with contemporary relevance. CON's arguments relied more on theoretical distinctions.\n\n**Evidence:** PRO cited multiple specific examples (Orb\u00e1n, COVID-19, US/UK). CON's examples were less developed (EU mentioned but not explained in detail).\n\n**Clash:** Both engaged directly. PRO effectively rebutted CON's historical example. CON acknowledged manipulation but didn't fully address PRO's contemporary examples.\n\n**Weighing:** PRO consistently emphasized real-world harms. CON argued for potential benefits but didn't effectively weigh against PRO's concrete examples of current destructive effects.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won by providing concrete contemporary examples of nationalism's destructive effects (Orb\u00e1n, COVID-19, polarization) and effectively weighing real-world harms.

PRO's COVID-19 example remained largely unrefuted, and their rebuttal of CON's post-WWII example was effective.\"\n}\n```",
