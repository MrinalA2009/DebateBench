  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n**Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis:**\n\nPRO's strongest arguments:\n1. Future job market preparation (13% growth in tech jobs)\n2. Cognitive development benefits (UC study on logical reasoning)\n3. Creativity and innovation through programming\n\nCON's strongest arguments:\n1. Curriculum overload and resource strain\n2. Developmental inappropreness for young children\n3. Educational inequality concerns\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n\nOn curriculum overload: CON argues mandatory programming requires dedicated time that must come from somewhere. PRO responds with \"interdisciplinary approaches\" but CON effectively rebuts this as \"superficial integration\" without concrete implementation plans.\n\nOn developmental appropriateness: PRO cites ScratchJr as evidence children can learn programming. CON effectively distinguishes between \"computational thinking tools\" and \"formal programming,\" arguing PRO conflates the two.\n\nOn inequality: PRO claims mandating programming creates a \"level playing field.\" CON rebuts that simply mandating doesn't create resources, and PRO provides no concrete funding mechanism.\n\n**Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO's strongest surviving argument is the cognitive development benefit, supported by the UC study. However, this is weakened by CON's developmental appropriateness challenge.\n\nCON's strongest surviving argument is the resource strain/curriculum overload concern, which PRO never adequately addresses with concrete solutions. CON's point that \"interdisciplinary approaches\" don't solve the time allocation problem stands largely unrefuted.\n\nThe critical weighing issue: PRO focuses on future benefits but doesn't address immediate implementation costs. CON emphasizes practical barriers that PRO dismisses without concrete solutions.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n\nCON provides clearer comparative weighing by showing how the mandate would immediately harm existing education (curriculum dilution, resource strain, inequality). PRO's benefits are future-oriented but lack implementation mechanisms. CON's impacts are more immediate and probable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior clash and weighing. PRO failed to provide concrete implementation plans for resource allocation and teacher training. CON effectively distinguished between computational thinking tools and formal programming, undermining PRO's developmental appropriateness claims. CON's curriculum overload argument remained largely unrefuted, as PRO's interdisciplinary approach lacked specificity.
