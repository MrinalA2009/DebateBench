  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Core Arguments:**\n1. Nationalism creates \"us vs them\" mentality leading to marginalization\n2. Historical evidence (WWs, recent movements) shows destructive outcomes\n3. Nationalism undermines global cooperation (climate crisis example)\n4. Prioritizes majority at expense of minorities\n\n**CON's Core Arguments:**\n1. Nationalism fosters identity/belonging and social cohesion\n2. Enhances democratic governance through civic engagement\n3. Can coexist with global cooperation\n4. Canada example shows inclusive nationalism is possible\n\n**After Clash:**\n- PRO effectively challenges CON's unity claim by arguing it comes through exclusion\n- CON responds with Canada counterexample, but this remains largely uncontested by PRO\n- PRO's climate crisis example (national interests vs. cooperation) stands with limited direct refutation\n- CON's civic engagement claim is challenged but not fully dismantled\n- PRO's historical evidence (WWs, hate crimes) remains largely unaddressed by CON\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's Strongest Remaining Argument:** Nationalism undermines global cooperation and marginalizes minorities, supported by historical evidence and contemporary examples (Brexit hate crimes, climate inaction).\n\n**CON's Strongest Remaining Argument:** Responsible nationalism can foster unity and civic engagement, with Canada as a counterexample.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO emphasizes magnitude (world wars, climate crisis, hate crimes) and provides specific examples\n- CON focuses on potential benefits but relies heavily on one example (Canada) and theoretical possibilities\n- PRO's impacts are more concrete and historically grounded\n- CON's \"responsible nationalism\" remains largely theoretical without sufficient evidence of widespread application\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure, consistent logic (4)\n- CON: Coherent but relies on idealized version of nationalism (3)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Multiple historical examples, specific policies cited (4)\n- CON: Limited to Canada example, more theoretical (3)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages CON's unity and cooperation claims (4)\n- CON: Responds but doesn't adequately address historical evidence (3)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clear magnitude comparison (wars, climate, hate crimes vs. civic engagement) (4)\n- CON: Some weighing but doesn't effectively compare scale of impacts (2)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior impact weighing and evidence. While CON presents a coherent case for responsible nationalism, PRO's historical examples (world wars, Brexit hate crimes, climate inaction) and comparative weighing of magnitude demonstrate nationalism's destructive effects outweigh theoretical benefits. CON's Canada example remains insufficient to counter PRO's broader evidence base.\"\n}\n```",
