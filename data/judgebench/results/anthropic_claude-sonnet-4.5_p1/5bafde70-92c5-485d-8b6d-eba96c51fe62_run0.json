  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Tipping perpetuates bias against marginalized workers (women, people of color receive lower tips)\n2. Higher wages provide economic stability and reduce poverty among service workers\n3. Stable wages lead to lower turnover and reduced training costs for businesses\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Tipping allows skilled workers to earn more than flat wages (Cornell study cited)\n2. Tipping provides consumer accountability mechanism for service quality\n3. Higher wage mandates create economic burden on small businesses\n\n**After Clash:**\n- PRO's bias argument remains strong; CON acknowledges bias exists but doesn't refute that tipping exacerbates income inequality\n- CON's earning potential argument is weakened by PRO's point about disparities, though not eliminated\n- CON's accountability argument stands but PRO counters that stable wages create consistent service\n- PRO's turnover cost argument is partially countered by CON's short-term burden concern\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO emphasizes systemic fairness affecting all marginalized workers (broad scope, ongoing harm)\n- CON emphasizes individual earning potential and business viability (narrower scope, economic concern)\n- PRO provides mechanism (stable wages \u2192 lower turnover \u2192 business benefit)\n- CON's business burden argument lacks specific evidence beyond assertion\n\n**Key Differentiator:**\nPRO more effectively weighs the systemic inequality impact and provides a clearer causal chain for how higher wages benefit all stakeholders. CON's arguments about earning potential don't adequately address the disparity issue, and the business burden claim lacks evidentiary support compared to PRO's turnover cost argument.\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:** PRO 4, CON 4 (both presented clear, structured cases)\n**Evidence:** PRO 4, CON 3 (PRO cited EPI and bias research; CON cited Cornell but less integration)\n**Clash:** PRO 4, CON 3 (PRO directly addressed earning potential and accountability; CON less effective on bias)\n**Weighing:** PRO 4, CON 3 (PRO compared systemic vs. individual impacts; CON focused more on asserting harms)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on superior impact weighing and clash. While CON effectively argued earning potential and accountability, PRO's systemic bias argument remained largely unrefuted and was weighed as affecting broader populations. PRO also provided stronger evidence integration regarding turnover costs offsetting business burdens, while CON's economic harm claims lacked comparable support.\"\n}\n```",
