  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Tipping creates wage instability (supported by One Fair Wage study showing 2x poverty rate)\n2. Tipping fosters discrimination and harassment (supported by ROC United studies)\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Tipping incentivizes exceptional service (Cornell study cited)\n2. Tipping allows income flexibility\n3. Abolition would cause job losses and price increases\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO effectively refuted CON's \"flexibility\" argument by reframing it as instability\n- PRO challenged the service incentive claim by arguing it creates inconsistent service\n- CON's rebuttal largely echoed PRO's points rather than defending their own position\n- CON failed to defend against PRO's discrimination/harassment argument\n- Neither side provided strong defense of their evidence claims\n\n**Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n- PRO: Wage instability and discrimination (largely uncontested)\n- CON: Service incentive argument (weakened but not eliminated)\n\n## Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation\n\nPRO's wage instability argument is supported by specific evidence (2x poverty rate) and directly addresses worker welfare. The discrimination argument went largely unaddressed by CON.\n\nCON's service incentive argument was challenged but maintained some standing. However, CON's rebuttal paradoxically agreed with PRO's points about inconsistent service, undermining their own position.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO explicitly weighed poverty and harassment as significant harms\n- CON provided minimal comparative weighing\n- PRO's impacts (financial security, reduced harassment) are more concrete than CON's (service quality maintenance)\n\n## Scoring\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (clear, coherent structure with logical progression)\n- CON: 3 (some internal contradictions in rebuttal, less coherent overall)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 4 (specific studies cited with concrete data points)\n- CON: 3 (studies mentioned but less specific integration)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 4 (directly engaged CON's arguments, effective reframing)\n- CON: 2 (rebuttal largely agreed with PRO, minimal defense of own position)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 4 (clear comparative weighing in summary, magnitude and scope addressed)\n- CON: 2 (minimal weighing, mostly restated benefits without comparison)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won through superior clash and weighing.
