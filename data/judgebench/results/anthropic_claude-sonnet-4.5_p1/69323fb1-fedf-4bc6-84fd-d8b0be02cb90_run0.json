  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Aviation emissions are projected to double/triple by 2050 (ICAO data)\n2. Rationing targets the 1% causing 50% of emissions (Global Environmental Change study)\n3. Technology solutions are decades away and insufficient for immediate crisis\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Rationing would affect essential travelers (small businesses, medical professionals, family visits)\n2. Aviation industry is making progress on sustainable fuels and technology\n3. Rationing could shift emissions to other transport modes\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO effectively refuted CON's \"regressive\" claim by emphasizing the targeting of high-frequency flyers\n- CON's technology argument was weakened by PRO's point about timeline insufficiency\n- CON's \"essential travel\" argument persisted but PRO claimed exemptions would apply\n- CON's modal shift argument remained largely unaddressed by PRO\n\n## Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's Impact:** Climate catastrophe from unchecked aviation growth (high magnitude, high probability given ICAO projections, immediate timeframe)\n\n**CON's Impact:** Economic disruption and inequity (moderate magnitude, probability contested by PRO's exemption claims, less clearly weighed)\n\nPRO provided clearer impact weighing with specific data (1% causing 50%, doubling/tripling emissions). CON's impacts were more speculative and less quantified.\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:** PRO maintained clearer logical structure with specific mechanisms. CON's arguments about essential travel became somewhat circular when PRO claimed exemptions.\n\n**Evidence:** PRO cited two specific sources (ICAO, Global Environmental Change 2020). CON referenced industry developments but without specific citations.\n\n**Clash:** PRO directly engaged CON's regressive claim and technology argument. CON engaged but less effectively on the core targeting mechanism.\n\n**Weighing:** PRO explicitly compared climate catastrophe vs. inconvenience. CON discussed consequences but didn't clearly weigh against climate impacts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won through superior impact weighing and evidence.
