  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n- Restorative justice framework with empirical support (victim satisfaction, closure, healing)\n- Victim impact statements as existing, functional tools\n- Structured programs can balance victim input with legal standards\n- Sentencing occurs post-guilt, so doesn't violate \"innocent until proven guilty\"\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n- Emotional victim input leads to inconsistent, biased sentencing\n- Judges are human and susceptible to emotional influence despite training\n- Victim involvement compromises judicial impartiality and objectivity\n- Focus on individual grievances detracts from systemic goals (deterrence, rehabilitation)\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO claims structured programs prevent inconsistency; CON responds that emotional weight still skews outcomes even with guidelines\n- PRO argues sentencing is post-guilt; CON counters that fairness principles still apply in sentencing phase\n- PRO emphasizes restorative justice benefits; CON argues this doesn't justify compromising legal integrity\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Key Distinction:**\nCON effectively challenges PRO's central mechanism - that structured programs can adequately control for emotional bias. CON's argument that \"judges are human and can be influenced by emotional narratives\" directly undermines PRO's claim that victim input can be balanced with legal standards.\n\nPRO's empirical claims about victim satisfaction and reduced recidivism are never directly refuted, but CON successfully reframes the debate around systemic integrity versus individual satisfaction.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Individual healing, victim satisfaction, reduced recidivism\n- CON: Systemic fairness, consistency across cases, protection of accused rights, maintaining legal objectivity\n\nCON provides clearer comparative weighing by arguing that systemic integrity affects all cases, while PRO's benefits are case-specific. CON's \"slippery slope\" and \"punitive environment driven by vengeance\" framing creates larger-scale impacts.\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:** Both sides present coherent arguments. CON slightly edges with clearer internal consistency about systemic concerns.\n\n**Evidence:** PRO references empirical studies and existing programs; CON relies more on logical reasoning about human nature and legal principles. PRO has slight edge.\n\n**Clash:** CON more directly engages PRO's mechanisms (structured programs, judge training). PRO addresses concerns but less directly refutes CON's core objection about emotional influence.\n\n**Weighing:** CON provides clearer comparative analysis (systemic vs. individual impacts, all cases vs. specific cases). PRO mentions weighing but doesn't comparatively prioritize as effectively.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior clash and weighing. CON effectively undermines PRO's mechanism that structured programs prevent bias by arguing judges remain susceptible to emotional influence. CON's systemic fairness impacts (affecting all cases) outweigh PRO's individual benefits (victim satisfaction, healing). While PRO provides empirical support, CON's comparative framework on maintaining legal objectivity proves more decisive in the final analysis.\"\n}\n```",
