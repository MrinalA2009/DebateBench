  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n**Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis:**\n\nPRO's strongest arguments:\n1. Future job market preparation (13% growth in tech jobs)\n2. Cognitive development benefits (UC study on logical reasoning)\n3. Creativity and innovation through programming\n\nCON's strongest arguments:\n1. Curriculum overload and resource strain\n2. Developmental inappropreness for young children\n3. Educational inequality concerns\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n\nOn curriculum overload: CON argues mandatory programming requires dedicated time that must come from somewhere. PRO responds with \"interdisciplinary approaches\" but CON effectively rebuts this as theoretical rather than practical, noting it often means \"superficial integration.\"\n\nOn developmental appropriateness: PRO cites ScratchJr as evidence young children can learn programming. CON effectively counters that ScratchJr teaches computational thinking, not formal programming, and that PRO's own resolution calls for \"programming\" which requires abstract reasoning.\n\nOn inequality: PRO claims mandating programming creates a \"level playing field.\" CON rebuts that simply mandating doesn't create resources, and PRO offers no concrete implementation plan.\n\n**Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO's future job market argument remains standing but is weakened by unaddressed implementation concerns. CON's curriculum overload argument survives PRO's rebuttal, as PRO never adequately explains where the time comes from. CON's developmental appropriateness argument is strengthened by catching PRO's conflation of computational thinking tools with formal programming. CON's inequality argument stands largely unrefuted, as PRO provides no concrete resource allocation plan.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n\nPRO emphasizes long-term benefits (future jobs, cognitive skills) but doesn't weigh against immediate harms. CON weighs the immediate, concrete harms (curriculum dilution, resource strain, inequality) against speculative future benefits. CON's impacts are more immediate and certain, while PRO's are longer-term but less certain given implementation challenges.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior clash and weighing.
