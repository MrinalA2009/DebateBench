  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Ownership leads to international conflict (supported by historical examples, Outer Space Treaty rationale)\n2. Ownership causes unchecked exploitation (profit motive vs. sustainability)\n3. Celestial bodies are shared heritage of humanity\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Ownership drives innovation and economic growth\n2. Regulated ownership promotes international cooperation\n3. Ownership leads to responsible stewardship\n\n**After Clash:**\n- PRO effectively refuted CON's cooperation claim using historical precedent (scramble for Africa, resource wars)\n- PRO challenged the stewardship argument by highlighting profit motives and enforcement difficulties\n- PRO addressed inequality concerns that CON didn't adequately defend\n- CON's rebuttal largely echoed PRO's arguments rather than defending their own position\n- CON's summary appears to argue FOR the resolution rather than against it (a critical error)\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\nPRO's strongest surviving argument: Ownership creates international conflict based on historical precedent and undermines the Outer Space Treaty framework.\n\nCON's strongest surviving argument: Ownership incentivizes innovation and investment (though weakened by PRO's inequality response).\n\nPRO provided clearer impact weighing (conflict, inequality, environmental degradation) with specific mechanisms. CON's impacts (innovation, cooperation) were undermined by PRO's refutation and lacked defensive responses.\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (clear, logical, consistent throughout)\n- CON: 2 (CON's summary contradicts their position, arguing PRO's side)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 4 (historical examples, treaty references, clear mechanisms)\n- CON: 3 (some examples like SpaceX, but less developed)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 5 (directly engaged all CON arguments with specific refutations)\n- CON: 2 (rebuttal echoed PRO's points; failed to defend own position)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 4 (clear comparative weighing of conflict, inequality, degradation)\n- CON: 2 (minimal weighing; contradictory summary)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won decisively through effective refutation of CON's cooperation and stewardship claims using historical precedent.
