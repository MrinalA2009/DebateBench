  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Environmental impact (5-14x more polluting than commercial, 50x more than trains)\n2. Social inequity and resource misallocation\n3. Immediate action needed vs. waiting for future tech\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Economic impact (jobs, revenue, related industries)\n2. Essential functions (medical, humanitarian)\n3. Innovation potential in green aviation tech\n\n**After Clash:**\n- PRO effectively refutes CON's economic argument by noting resource reallocation could create more jobs\n- PRO successfully challenges the \"essential functions\" claim as exceptions, not the rule\n- PRO directly attacks the \"wait for green tech\" position as dangerous deferral\n- CON's rebuttal appears confused - it actually concedes PRO's points about economic reallocation and minimal essential use\n- CON fails to defend against PRO's timeline critique effectively\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's Strongest Remaining Argument:** Immediate environmental action is necessary; private jets are disproportionately polluting and waiting for future tech is too slow.\n\n**CON's Strongest Remaining Argument:** Innovation in sustainable aviation should be encouraged rather than banned.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO provides specific comparative data (5-14x, 50x multipliers)\n- PRO emphasizes urgency and magnitude of climate crisis\n- CON's innovation argument lacks timeframe specificity\n- PRO directly addresses and undermines CON's weighing by highlighting the delay problem\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear, consistent structure with specific environmental and equity claims (4)\n- CON: Some internal confusion in rebuttal where they concede PRO's points (3)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Specific 2023 Transport & Environment report with quantified comparisons (5)\n- CON: Generic claims about jobs and revenue without specific data (2)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engages all CON arguments with specific refutations (5)\n- CON: Minimal engagement with PRO's core environmental data; confused rebuttal (2)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clear comparative weighing on timeline, magnitude, and urgency (5)\n- CON: Attempts weighing but lacks specificity and concedes key points (2)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins decisively through superior evidence (specific pollution multipliers), effective refutation of all CON arguments, and clear impact weighing on urgency. CON's rebuttal paradoxically conceded key PRO points about economic reallocation and minimal essential use, while failing to defend against PRO's timeline critique of waiting for future green technologies.\"\n}\n```",
