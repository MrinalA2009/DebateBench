  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Individual autonomy for competent adults facing terminal illness\n2. Assisted suicide as last resort when palliative care fails to alleviate intractable suffering\n3. Safeguards can prevent abuse\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Slippery slope - expansion beyond terminally ill (Netherlands/Belgium examples)\n2. Palliative care advancements can manage most suffering\n3. Safeguards insufficient to prevent coercion of vulnerable individuals\n\n**After Clash:**\n- PRO effectively counters slippery slope as fallacy, emphasizing strict parameters for terminally ill only\n- CON provides concrete examples (Netherlands/Belgium) but PRO argues this doesn't negate ethical justification\n- PRO concedes palliative care value but maintains it's not universal solution\n- CON doesn't adequately address PRO's core autonomy argument\n- Both sides maintain their safeguard positions without decisive refutation\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's surviving impact:** Individual autonomy + relief from intractable suffering when palliative care fails\n**CON's surviving impact:** Risk of expansion + potential coercion of vulnerable individuals\n\n**Weighing Analysis:**\n- PRO provides clearer impact weighing by framing assisted suicide as \"last resort\" with defined scope\n- CON's impacts are more speculative (future expansion, potential coercion) vs. PRO's immediate impacts (current suffering, current autonomy denial)\n- PRO better addresses magnitude (unbearable suffering) and probability (strict safeguards for defined population)\n- CON relies heavily on slippery slope without proving inevitability\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:** PRO maintains clearer logical structure around autonomy + suffering relief. CON's arguments are coherent but rely more on speculative concerns.\n\n**Evidence:** PRO cites AMA Council, Dr. Angell. CON cites Netherlands/Belgium examples. Both provide some grounding, but PRO integrates evidence more directly into framework.\n\n**Clash:** PRO directly engages each CON argument (slippery slope as fallacy, palliative care limitations, safeguard feasibility). CON engages but less effectively addresses core autonomy claim.\n\n**Weighing:** PRO explicitly frames comparative impacts (last resort, defined parameters, immediate suffering vs. prolonged agony). CON focuses more on risks without clear comparative framework.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins by better engaging CON's arguments and providing clearer impact weighing.
