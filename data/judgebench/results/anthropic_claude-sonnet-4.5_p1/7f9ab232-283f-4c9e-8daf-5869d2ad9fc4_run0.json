  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n**Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis:**\n\nPRO's main arguments:\n1. Technological advancement makes simulation feasible\n2. Fine-tuning of physical constants suggests design\n3. Simulation hypothesis explains Fermi Paradox\n\nCON's main arguments:\n1. Burden of proof not met by PRO\n2. Technological leap to full universe simulation is monumental\n3. Fine-tuning has alternative explanations (multiverse, natural processes)\n4. Fermi Paradox has simpler explanations\n\nAfter clash:\n- PRO's technological feasibility argument is weakened by CON's point about the gap between current simulations and full universe simulation\n- PRO's fine-tuning argument survives but is contested by CON's multiverse alternative\n- CON's burden of proof argument remains strong throughout\n- CON's alternative explanations for fine-tuning and Fermi Paradox remain unrefuted\n\n**Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO relies heavily on possibility and plausibility but struggles to demonstrate \"likelihood\" (the resolution's standard). CON effectively argues that possibility \u2260 probability and maintains that PRO hasn't met their burden.\n\nCON's strongest surviving argument is the burden of proof challenge combined with the lack of empirical evidence. PRO's strongest surviving argument is the fine-tuning observation, but this is significantly weakened by CON's alternative explanations.\n\n**Scoring Analysis:**\n\n**Argument Quality:** CON presents clearer logical structure around burden of proof. PRO's arguments are coherent but rely on speculative leaps.\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:** Both sides rely primarily on reasoning rather than concrete evidence, but CON better grounds their position in epistemological standards.\n\n**Clash & Refutation:** CON directly engages PRO's main points throughout. PRO responds but doesn't adequately defend against the burden of proof challenge.\n\n**Impact Weighing:** Neither side excels here, but CON implicitly weighs by emphasizing the extraordinary nature of the claim requiring extraordinary evidence.\n\nThe resolution requires showing we are \"likely\" living in a simulation. PRO never establishes probability, only possibility. CON successfully maintains this distinction throughout.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by successfully maintaining that PRO failed to meet their burden of proof.
