  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Core Arguments:**\n1. Deep-sea mining threatens unique ecosystems (90% species loss claim from NOAA)\n2. Mining releases toxic chemicals and sediment\n3. Alternative sources exist (recycling, waste reduction)\n\n**CON's Core Arguments:**\n1. Deep-sea minerals essential for renewable energy transition (IEA projection of 4x demand by 2040)\n2. Regulatory frameworks (ISA) and technology can mitigate impacts\n3. Terrestrial mining has greater environmental/social costs\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO claims alternatives exist; CON responds that recycling alone cannot meet volume demands and that PRO's own source confirms primary extraction remains necessary\n- PRO attacks ISA framework as \"in its infancy\"; CON counters with years of dedicated work and specific mechanisms (EIAs, protected areas)\n- PRO emphasizes ecosystem fragility; CON acknowledges but argues terrestrial alternatives are worse\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n- PRO: Ecosystem destruction with 90% species loss (partially contested but not fully refuted)\n- CON: Necessity for renewable energy transition with no viable alternative at scale (PRO's recycling alternative effectively refuted as insufficient)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\nCON provides clearer comparative weighing - they directly address why their impact (enabling global decarbonization) outweighs PRO's concerns, and they turn PRO's environmental concerns by arguing terrestrial mining is worse. PRO focuses on deep-sea risks but doesn't effectively weigh these against CON's climate change argument or explain why their alternatives are sufficient at scale.\n\n## Scoring\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 3 (Clear initial case but recycling alternative not well-developed for scale)\n- CON: 4 (Coherent necessity argument with clear logical structure)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 3 (NOAA report cited but European Commission report used incompletely)\n- CON: 4 (IEA projections, ISA framework details, addresses PRO's sources)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 3 (Engages but doesn't effectively counter scalability arguments)\n- CON: 4 (Directly refutes recycling alternative, addresses regulatory concerns)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 2 (Emphasizes risks but minimal comparative weighing)\n- CON: 4 (Clear comparison: climate change vs. deep-sea impacts, terrestrial vs. deep-sea mining)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by effectively refuting PRO's recycling alternative as insufficient for scale and providing superior impact weighing. CON's argument that prohibition hinders renewable energy transition while terrestrial mining causes greater harm went largely uncontested.
