  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Tipping perpetuates bias against marginalized workers (women, people of color receive lower tips)\n2. Higher wages provide economic stability and reduce poverty among service workers\n3. Stable wages lead to lower turnover and reduced training costs for businesses\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Tipping allows high-performing workers to earn more than flat wages (Cornell study cited)\n2. Tipping provides consumer accountability mechanism for service quality\n3. Mandating higher wages creates economic burden on small businesses\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO addresses CON's earning potential claim by noting it ignores bias disparities\n- CON responds that bias exists regardless of payment structure and removing tipping just caps income\n- PRO argues stable wages improve service consistency; CON counters that tips incentivize better service\n- Both sides dispute economic impact on businesses with competing claims about costs vs. benefits\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Key Surviving Arguments:**\n\nPRO's bias argument remains strong - CON acknowledges bias exists but doesn't effectively counter how tipping exacerbates income inequality for marginalized workers. CON's response that \"bias exists everywhere\" doesn't address the mechanism by which tipping amplifies these disparities.\n\nCON's earning potential argument is weakened by PRO's point about disparate outcomes, but CON's merit-based compensation point stands for high-performers in favorable circumstances.\n\nCON's consumer accountability argument is partially countered by PRO's claim about transactional relationships, but PRO doesn't fully address how consumers would provide feedback under their system.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO emphasizes systemic fairness affecting all marginalized workers (broad scope)\n- CON emphasizes individual earning potential and business viability (narrower but immediate)\n- PRO provides mechanism (lower turnover, customer willingness to pay more) for economic sustainability\n- CON's economic burden argument is somewhat speculative about business closures\n\nPRO's fairness and stability arguments have broader scope affecting systemic inequality. CON's arguments favor status quo benefits for some workers but don't adequately address the inequality concerns PRO raises.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins on stronger impact weighing and clash.
