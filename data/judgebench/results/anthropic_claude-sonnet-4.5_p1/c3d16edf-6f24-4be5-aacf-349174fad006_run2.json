  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Remaining Argument:**\n- Diplomatic immunity creates accountability gaps when diplomats commit serious crimes\n- Current mechanisms (waivers, persona non grata) are ineffective and politically influenced\n- Limiting immunity to personal (non-official) acts would promote justice without harming diplomacy\n\n**CON's Strongest Remaining Argument:**\n- Diplomatic immunity is essential for functioning international relations per Vienna Convention\n- Limiting immunity would create subjective interpretations leading to politically motivated harassment\n- Reciprocal retaliation would destabilize diplomatic channels and international cooperation\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Key Clash Points:**\n1. **Effectiveness of current mechanisms**: PRO claims they're ineffective; CON claims they're robust. CON provides more specific examples (waivers, PNG declarations) while PRO only asserts ineffectiveness without evidence.\n\n2. **Official vs. Personal acts distinction**: PRO proposes this as workable; CON effectively argues this creates dangerous subjectivity that would be exploited. CON's argument about \"who decides\" is more concrete.\n\n3. **Impact comparison**: PRO offers speculative accountability benefits; CON presents immediate, concrete risks (retaliation cycles, disrupted diplomacy, harassment). CON's impacts are more tangible and probable.\n\n**Critical Weaknesses:**\n- PRO repeatedly asserts that \"most diplomats already respect local laws\" but provides no evidence or examples of abuse cases they mentioned in constructive\n- PRO dismisses Vienna Convention as \"different era\" without substantive justification\n- PRO fails to adequately respond to CON's reciprocity/retaliation argument\n- CON effectively demonstrates the practical problems with PRO's proposed distinction\n\n**Weighing:**\nCON provides clearer impact calculus: immediate disruption to international relations vs. speculative accountability gains. CON's argument about the subjectivity problem is largely unrefuted by PRO.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins on superior impact weighing and evidence. CON effectively demonstrated that PRO's official/personal distinction creates dangerous subjectivity enabling political harassment, while PRO failed to provide concrete examples of abuse or adequately respond to retaliation concerns. CON's impacts (destabilized diplomacy, reciprocal prosecution) are more immediate and probable than PRO's speculative accountability benefits. PRO's dismissal of existing mechanisms lacked evidentiary support.\"\n}\n```",
