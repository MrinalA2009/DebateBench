  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n- Government mandates (Equal Pay Act, Lilly Ledbetter Act) have historical success in reducing pay gaps\n- Even after controlling for variables, a 7% gap remains (AAUW study)\n- Systemic barriers require government intervention, not just market forces\n\n**CON's Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n- The 82-cent figure is misleading; adjusted gap is only 4.9% (Glassdoor study)\n- Government mandates create unintended consequences (reduced hiring, job losses, stifled innovation)\n- Market-based solutions and individual empowerment are more effective\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO acknowledges CON's controlled-variable argument but counters with AAUW 7% figure\n- CON directly challenges PRO's 82-cent statistic and questions whether AAUW controlled for all variables\n- CON distinguishes between overt discrimination (addressed by existing laws) and adjusted gap\n- PRO does not adequately respond to CON's unintended consequences argument\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO emphasizes moral, economic, and social implications but provides limited quantification\n- CON focuses on economic harm (job losses, reduced innovation) from mandates\n- CON's distinction between the 82-cent unadjusted gap and 4.9% adjusted gap is more specific\n- PRO's failure to address unintended consequences leaves this impact largely conceded\n\n**Key Differentiators:**\n1. CON provides more specific evidence (4.9% vs 7% adjusted gaps with clearer methodology)\n2. CON directly engages PRO's statistical claims while PRO largely reasserts original position\n3. PRO drops CON's unintended consequences argument\n4. CON's framework of \"efficacy and unintended consequences\" is more directly applied than PRO's broader moral/economic/social framework\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by effectively challenging PRO's foundational 82-cent statistic with more specific controlled data (4.9% adjusted gap), introducing unintended consequences that PRO never adequately addressed, and providing clearer comparative weighing.
