  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Common heritage preservation (Outer Space Treaty)\n2. Conflict prevention (territorial disputes lead to war)\n3. Scientific collaboration (ISS example)\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Ownership incentivizes investment/innovation\n2. Resource security for humanity's survival\n3. Facilitates human expansion into space\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO argues ownership leads to monopolization; CON responds that regulated frameworks can prevent this\n- PRO claims ownership causes conflict; CON counters that international legal frameworks can govern property rights\n- PRO points to ISS as collaborative success; CON distinguishes government-funded missions from self-sustaining economic models\n- CON argues common heritage has led to stagnation; PRO doesn't directly refute this claim\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n\nPRO: The conflict prevention argument remains partially standing, but CON effectively countered with the legal framework response.\n\nCON: The investment/innovation incentive argument survives strongly. PRO's rebuttal about exploitation doesn't directly address why the current system has produced limited large-scale development. CON's point about the Outer Space Treaty leading to stagnation is largely uncontested.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- CON explicitly weighs resource security as existential (finite Earth resources vs. vast celestial resources)\n- CON frames the choice as \"stagnation vs. progress\"\n- PRO focuses on preventing negative outcomes (conflict, inequality) but doesn't weigh these against CON's survival/expansion impacts\n- CON's timeframe argument (long-term human survival) is more concrete than PRO's conflict prevention\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure, coherent claims (4)\n- CON: Well-developed economic and survival framework (4)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Cites Outer Space Treaty, ISS example, but relies heavily on historical analogy (3)\n- CON: Provides mechanism (economic incentives), distinguishes government vs. private models (4)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Engages CON's points but responses are somewhat generic (3)\n- CON: Directly addresses PRO's concerns with legal framework solution, distinguishes ISS from economic model (4)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Identifies impacts but doesn't comparatively weigh against CON (2)\n- CON: Explicitly weighs stagnation vs. progress, frames as survival issue (4)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing and clash.
