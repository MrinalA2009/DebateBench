  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Core Arguments:**\n1. Nationalism creates \"us vs them\" mentality leading to marginalization\n2. Historical evidence (WWI, WWII) shows destructive consequences\n3. Recent examples (America First, Brexit) demonstrate xenophobic outcomes\n4. Nationalism undermines global cooperation (climate crisis example)\n\n**CON's Core Arguments:**\n1. Nationalism fosters identity and belonging, promoting social cohesion\n2. Nationalism enhances democratic governance through civic engagement\n3. Nationalism can coexist with global cooperation\n4. Canada as example of responsible nationalism with multiculturalism\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO directly challenges CON's unity claim, arguing it comes through exclusion\n- PRO refutes the democratic governance claim as unsupported\n- PRO attacks the coexistence argument using climate crisis as counterexample\n- CON responds with Canada example but doesn't fully address PRO's historical evidence\n- CON claims inclusivity is possible but provides limited evidence beyond Canada\n- Neither side fully drops major arguments, but PRO's historical examples remain largely unrefuted\n\n## Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's strongest remaining argument:** Nationalism's track record of causing division and undermining cooperation, supported by historical (WWI/WWII) and contemporary (Brexit, America First, climate crisis) examples.\n\n**CON's strongest remaining argument:** Responsible nationalism can promote unity and civic engagement, with Canada as a working example.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO emphasizes magnitude (world wars, climate crisis) and probability (consistent pattern)\n- CON emphasizes possibility but lacks comparative weighing against PRO's harms\n- PRO provides timeframe (historical to present) showing sustained pattern\n- CON's Canada example is singular versus PRO's multiple examples\n\n## Scoring\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear thesis, consistent logic, well-structured progression)\n- CON: 4 (Clear counter-position, coherent framework, logical flow)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 4 (Multiple historical and contemporary examples, specific policies cited)\n- CON: 3 (Canada example provided, but limited concrete evidence for broader claims)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 4 (Directly engages each CON argument, challenges assumptions, provides counterexamples)\n- CON: 3 (Responds to PRO but doesn't adequately address historical evidence or climate example)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear magnitude comparison, timeframe analysis, explicit weighing in summary)\n- CON: 2 (Acknowledges impacts but minimal comparative weighing, doesn't address scale of PRO's harms)\n\n## Decision\n\nPRO wins because they provided stronger comparative impact weighing and more extensive evidence. While CON presented a coherent vision of responsible nationalism, they failed to adequately refute PRO's historical examples or explain why their single Canada example outweighs PRO's multiple instances of nationalist harm. PRO's climate crisis argument particularly went largely unaddressed, and CON didn't effectively weigh their benefits against PRO's demonstrated harms.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior impact weighing and evidence depth.
