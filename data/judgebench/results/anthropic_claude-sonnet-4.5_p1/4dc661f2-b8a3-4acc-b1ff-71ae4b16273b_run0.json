  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n**Stage 1 - Argument Survival Analysis:**\n\nPRO's strongest remaining arguments:\n- Public health crisis (obesity, sleep disturbances, mental health) linked to excessive screen time\n- AAP guidelines provide evidence-based foundation\n- Legal framework supports parents rather than undermines them\n\nCON's strongest remaining arguments:\n- Governmental overreach into parental autonomy\n- Practical unenforceability without surveillance state\n- One-size-fits-all approach ignores individual circumstances and beneficial uses\n\n**Stage 2 - Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO established health harms but struggled to defend against enforcement concerns. Their claim that the law wouldn't be \"one-size-fits-all\" contradicts the nature of legal requirements. They didn't adequately address how enforcement would work without surveillance.\n\nCON effectively exploited the enforcement gap and highlighted the contradiction between \"guidelines\" and \"legal requirements.\" They demonstrated that AAP recommendations are meant to be flexible, not legally binding. CON's autonomy argument remained largely unrefuted - PRO never explained why this particular parenting decision requires legal intervention when others don't.\n\n**Scoring Analysis:**\n\n**Argument Quality:** CON presented more internally consistent arguments. PRO's claim that a legal requirement wouldn't be rigid contradicts basic legal principles. CON maintained logical coherence throughout.\n\n**Evidence:** PRO cited AAP guidelines but misapplied them as support for legal mandates. CON effectively recontextualized these as recommendations, not legal standards.\n\n**Clash:** CON directly engaged PRO's enforcement problem and the contradiction in their framework. PRO largely reasserted claims without addressing CON's core challenges about surveillance and rigidity.\n\n**Weighing:** CON explicitly weighed governmental intrusion and enforcement problems against generalized health concerns. PRO asserted importance but didn't comparatively weigh why legal intervention trumps parental autonomy.\n\nThe enforcement issue proved decisive - PRO never resolved how this would work practically, while CON demonstrated this creates either a toothless law or surveillance state.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON won by exposing fatal flaws in PRO's enforcement mechanism and the contradiction between legal mandates and flexibility.
