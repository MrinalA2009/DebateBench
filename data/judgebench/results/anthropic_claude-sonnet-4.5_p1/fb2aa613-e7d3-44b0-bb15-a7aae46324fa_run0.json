  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Convenience and accessibility (75% patient satisfaction)\n2. Cost-effectiveness (30% cost reduction)\n3. Telemedicine can handle routine visits (follow-ups, medication management)\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Physical examinations necessary for accurate diagnosis (JAMA study on diagnostic accuracy)\n2. Personal connection essential for trust and treatment adherence (APA findings)\n3. Digital divide creates health disparities\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO concedes physical exams are important but argues many routine visits don't require them\n- CON maintains physical assessments are needed even for routine conditions\n- PRO acknowledges digital divide but argues it should be addressed, not used to dismiss telemedicine\n- CON maintains digital divide is a current barrier that cannot be ignored\n- Both sides cite patient satisfaction/connection studies with competing claims\n\n## Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's Impact:** Increased accessibility, 30% cost reduction, patient satisfaction for majority (75%)\n**CON's Impact:** Diagnostic accuracy for complex cases, treatment adherence through personal connection, health equity concerns\n\n**Key Weighing Factors:**\n- PRO argues telemedicine for \"most\" routine visits, preserving in-person for complex cases\n- CON argues even routine visits benefit from physical examination\n- CON's equity argument remains largely unrefuted in terms of current impact\n- PRO's cost/accessibility benefits are quantified; CON's diagnostic accuracy claims lack specific comparative data\n\n**Critical Observation:**\nPRO better addresses the resolution's scope (\"most routine visits\") by distinguishing between truly routine visits and complex cases. CON conflates all visits and doesn't effectively counter that many routine visits (medication refills, follow-ups) don't require physical examination.\n\n## Scoring\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear framework, logical distinction between routine and complex)\n- CON: 4 (Well-structured, coherent arguments about care quality)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 4 (Specific statistics: 75% satisfaction, 30% cost reduction, named sources)\n- CON: 3 (Named sources but less specific quantification of impacts)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 4 (Directly addresses physical exam concern, digital divide, personal connection)\n- CON: 3 (Reasserts positions but doesn't fully engage with PRO's distinction about routine vs. complex)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear comparison: cost savings, accessibility vs. concerns; argues concerns are addressable)\n- CON: 3 (Identifies important impacts but limited comparative weighing of magnitude/probability)\n\n## Decision\n\nPRO wins because they better defined the scope of \"most routine visits,\" provided quantified benefits, and effectively argued that physical examination concerns apply to complex rather than routine cases. CON's strongest argument (digital divide) was acknowledged but countered with feasibility of solutions. PRO's cost and accessibility impacts affect broader population with higher probability than CON's diagnostic accuracy concerns for truly routine visits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins by effectively distinguishing routine visits from complex cases, providing quantified benefits (30% cost reduction, 75% satisfaction), and directly refuting CON's concerns.
