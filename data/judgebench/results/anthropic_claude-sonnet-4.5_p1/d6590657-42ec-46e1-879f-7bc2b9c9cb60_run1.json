  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Common heritage preservation (Outer Space Treaty)\n2. Conflict prevention (territorial disputes lead to war)\n3. Scientific collaboration (ISS example)\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Ownership incentivizes investment/innovation\n2. Resource security for human survival\n3. Facilitates human expansion into space\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO argues ownership leads to monopolization; CON responds that regulated frameworks can prevent this\n- PRO claims ownership causes conflict; CON counters that international legal frameworks can govern property rights\n- PRO points to ISS as collaborative success; CON distinguishes government-funded missions from self-sustaining economic models\n- CON argues common heritage has led to stagnation; PRO doesn't directly refute this empirical claim\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n- **PRO**: Conflict prevention argument remains, but weakened by CON's legal framework response\n- **CON**: Economic incentive argument stands relatively unrefuted - PRO doesn't address why collaboration alone would generate necessary capital for large-scale development\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- CON explicitly weighs: resource depletion vs. stagnation, survival vs. idealism\n- PRO weighs: inequality and conflict vs. cooperation benefits\n- CON provides clearer comparative framework (stagnation vs. progress)\n\n## Scoring Assessment\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (clear structure, coherent claims)\n- CON: 4 (well-organized, logical progression)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 3 (cites Outer Space Treaty, ISS example, but limited mechanistic explanation)\n- CON: 4 (provides economic reasoning, distinguishes government vs. private models, addresses resource scarcity with specific examples)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 3 (engages CON's points but doesn't address stagnation claim or economic mechanism)\n- CON: 4 (directly addresses monopolization, conflict concerns, distinguishes ISS from settlement economics)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 3 (identifies impacts but limited comparative analysis)\n- CON: 4 (explicit comparison of stagnation vs. progress, survival framing)\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nCON more effectively refuted PRO's conflict argument by proposing legal frameworks, while PRO failed to address CON's core economic incentive argument. CON's distinction between government collaboration (ISS) and private economic development for settlements was not adequately answered. The stagnation claim under current frameworks went largely uncontested.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON won by effectively refuting PRO's conflict concerns through legal framework solutions while PRO failed to address CON's core economic incentive argument.
