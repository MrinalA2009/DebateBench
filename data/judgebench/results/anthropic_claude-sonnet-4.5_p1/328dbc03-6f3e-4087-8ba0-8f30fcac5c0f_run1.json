  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Public health crisis (obesity, sleep deprivation, developmental delays) - Supported with AAP guidelines and JAMA Pediatrics study\n2. Legal precedent exists (car seats, vaccinations) for limiting parental autonomy when child welfare is at stake\n3. Legal framework empowers parents against digital pressures\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Parental autonomy - parents best understand individual children's needs\n2. Not all screen time is harmful - educational content provides benefits (Joan Ganz Cooney Center study)\n3. Legal mandates could damage parent-child relationships\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO effectively countered CON's \"not all screen time equal\" argument by clarifying the resolution calls for limits, not bans\n- PRO's car seat/vaccination analogy was challenged by CON as misleading, but CON didn't fully refute the underlying principle\n- CON's relationship damage argument remained speculative, while PRO provided counter-reasoning about parental empowerment\n- CON didn't adequately address PRO's specific health data (JAMA study, AAP recommendations)\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Magnitude = widespread health crisis affecting entire generation; Probability = supported by studies showing current harm; Timeframe = immediate and long-term\n- CON: Magnitude = parental rights and educational benefits; Probability = speculative regarding relationship damage; Timeframe = ongoing\n\nPRO provided more concrete evidence of current harm, while CON's impacts were more theoretical. PRO's legal precedent argument (car seats/vaccinations) survived CON's rebuttal better than CON's autonomy argument survived PRO's public health framing.\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:** PRO 4, CON 3 - PRO maintained clearer internal consistency; CON's arguments about autonomy conflicted somewhat with acknowledging screen time concerns\n\n**Evidence:** PRO 4, CON 3 - PRO cited specific studies (JAMA, AAP, NIH); CON cited one study but relied more on general assertions\n\n**Clash:** PRO 4, CON 3 - PRO directly engaged CON's autonomy and \"not all screen time equal\" arguments; CON engaged but less effectively on health data\n\n**Weighing:** PRO 4, CON 2 - PRO explicitly compared magnitude/scope of health crisis; CON provided minimal comparative weighing between autonomy and health outcomes\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won by establishing a concrete public health crisis with specific evidence (JAMA, AAP studies) and effectively using legal precedent analogies. CON's parental autonomy argument was weakened by failure to address PRO's health data directly. PRO's comparative weighing between generational health impacts versus theoretical relationship concerns proved more decisive than CON's largely defensive position.\"\n}\n```",
