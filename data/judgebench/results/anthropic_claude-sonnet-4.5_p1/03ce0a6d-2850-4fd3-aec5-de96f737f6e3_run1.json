  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n**Stage 1 - Argument Survival Analysis:**\n\nPRO's main arguments:\n1. Ownership leads to international conflict (supported by historical examples, Outer Space Treaty rationale)\n2. Ownership causes unchecked exploitation (profit motive vs. sustainability)\n3. Celestial bodies are shared heritage of humanity\n\nCON's main arguments:\n1. Ownership drives innovation and economic growth\n2. Regulated ownership promotes international cooperation\n3. Ownership leads to responsible stewardship\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n\nPRO effectively refuted CON's cooperation argument by citing historical precedent (scramble for Africa, resource wars) and pointing out that the Outer Space Treaty was specifically designed to prevent ownership-based conflicts.\n\nPRO also challenged the stewardship claim by noting profit motives override environmental concerns and enforcement would be impossible in space.\n\nCON's rebuttal largely echoed PRO's arguments rather than defending their own position - they actually reinforced PRO's points about conflict, inequality, and environmental degradation.\n\n**Stage 2 - Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO's strongest surviving argument: Ownership creates international conflict, supported by historical precedent and the rationale behind existing space law.\n\nCON's arguments were significantly weakened because:\n- The innovation argument was countered with inequality concerns\n- The cooperation argument was directly contradicted by historical evidence\n- The stewardship argument was refuted with profit motive analysis\n- CON's own rebuttal/summary conceded many of PRO's points\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n\nPRO clearly articulated catastrophic impacts: international conflict, global inequality, irreversible environmental degradation. These were compared directly to CON's hypothetical benefits.\n\nCON failed to weigh their impacts against PRO's or explain why innovation benefits would outweigh conflict risks.\n\n**Scoring Rationale:**\n\nPRO maintained consistent argumentation with strong historical grounding and effective refutation. CON's position was undermined by their own concessions in rebuttal and failure to defend core claims.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won decisively through effective refutation using historical precedent and existing space law rationale.
