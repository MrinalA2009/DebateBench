  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n**Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis:**\n\nPRO's strongest remaining arguments:\n- Immediate emissions reduction is necessary given climate urgency\n- Current system is inequitable (wealthy benefit, all bear costs)\n- Rationing combined with tech investment is comprehensive\n\nCON's strongest remaining arguments:\n- Rationing causes severe economic damage to global commerce and developing nations\n- Technological innovation (SAFs, electric aircraft) offers decarbonization without economic harm\n- Aviation represents small percentage of emissions; rationing has disproportionate cost-to-benefit ratio\n\n**Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO argues urgency requires immediate action, but doesn't adequately defend against CON's economic impact arguments or provide mechanisms showing rationing wouldn't simply price out lower-income travelers. PRO's equity claim is weakened by CON's rebuttal that carbon pricing creates two-tiered access.\n\nCON effectively argues that:\n1. Economic costs are immediate and severe (job losses, trade disruption)\n2. Technological solutions are already in development (not distant)\n3. Aviation's 2.5% contribution makes rationing disproportionately harmful relative to impact\n\nCON's weighing on magnitude (economic devastation vs. small emissions percentage) and probability (guaranteed economic harm vs. uncertain climate mitigation from rationing alone) is more developed. PRO doesn't effectively counter the \"blunt instrument\" framing or demonstrate why rationing is superior to accelerated tech investment.\n\n**Scoring Analysis:**\n\n- **Argument Quality**: CON presents more internally consistent logic about economic mechanisms; PRO's equity argument contradicts their carbon pricing proposal\n- **Evidence**: Both cite general facts (2.5%, SAF development), but CON integrates specific examples (Airbus hydrogen aircraft)\n- **Clash**: CON directly engages PRO's equity and urgency claims; PRO somewhat repeats assertions without fully addressing economic impact weighing\n- **Weighing**: CON provides clearer comparative analysis (economic harm vs. emissions impact, immediate vs. long-term)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing, demonstrating that rationing's guaranteed economic devastation outweighs uncertain climate benefits from aviation's 2.5% emissions share. CON effectively refuted PRO's equity claim by showing carbon pricing creates wealth-based access, while PRO failed to adequately defend against economic harm arguments or explain why immediate rationing beats accelerated technological solutions.\"\n}\n```",
