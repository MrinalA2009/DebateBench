  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Cognitive benefits (Bialystok study on dementia delay, enhanced problem-solving)\n2. Economic advantages (global competitiveness, higher salaries)\n3. Cultural understanding and social cohesion\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Resource strain on already struggling schools\n2. Linguistic diversity makes implementation impractical\n3. Cognitive benefits not universally accepted\n4. Voluntary programs more effective\n\n**After Clash:**\n- PRO effectively counters the \"one-size-fits-all\" criticism by clarifying that mandatory means universal access with flexible language choices\n- PRO addresses resource concerns by framing bilingual education as strategic investment with long-term returns\n- CON maintains that immediate resource constraints are real and pressing\n- CON's argument about cognitive benefits being disputed is weakened by PRO's citation of \"overwhelming consensus\" and specific research\n- CON's voluntary program argument remains unrefuted in terms of engagement\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's surviving impact:** Enhanced cognitive development with specific evidence (4.5 year dementia delay), economic competitiveness in globalized world, with flexibility in implementation\n\n**CON's surviving impact:** Immediate resource strain on struggling schools, practical implementation challenges given linguistic diversity\n\n**Weighing Analysis:**\n- PRO provides specific evidence (Bialystok study, ACTFL data) while CON relies more on general concerns\n- PRO addresses CON's main objections directly (flexibility vs. one-size-fits-all, investment vs. diversion)\n- CON's resource argument is real but doesn't engage with PRO's long-term benefit framing\n- CON's cognitive benefits dispute is undermined by lack of counter-evidence\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:** PRO 4, CON 3 - PRO maintains clearer logical structure and addresses objections more directly\n**Evidence:** PRO 4, CON 2 - PRO cites specific studies and organizations; CON relies on general assertions\n**Clash:** PRO 4, CON 3 - PRO directly engages each CON argument; CON repeats points without fully addressing PRO's rebuttals\n**Weighing:** PRO 4, CON 2 - PRO explicitly compares long-term vs. short-term impacts; CON focuses on immediate concerns without comparative analysis\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior evidence (Bialystok study, ACTFL data) and effective weighing of long-term cognitive and economic benefits against short-term costs.
