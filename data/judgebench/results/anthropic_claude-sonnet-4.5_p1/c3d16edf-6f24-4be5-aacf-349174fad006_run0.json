  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Remaining Argument:**\nThat diplomatic immunity creates a culture of impunity where diplomats can commit serious crimes (human trafficking, assault, espionage) without accountability, and that limiting immunity to personal (non-official) acts would promote justice without harming legitimate diplomatic functions.\n\n**CON's Strongest Remaining Argument:**\nThat diplomatic immunity is essential for effective diplomacy under the Vienna Convention, and that limiting it would create subjective interpretations of \"official vs. personal\" acts, leading to politically motivated harassment and a cycle of retaliation that would destabilize international relations.\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Key Clash Points:**\n1. **Mechanism feasibility**: PRO proposes distinguishing official/personal acts; CON argues this is unworkably subjective\n2. **Retaliation risk**: PRO claims existing mechanisms already exist; CON argues limitation would trigger reciprocal actions\n3. **Current system adequacy**: PRO says waivers/PNG are ineffective; CON says they maintain system integrity\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- CON provides clearer comparative weighing: \"speculative promise of accountability\" vs. \"very real and immediate threat of destabilized relations\"\n- CON emphasizes magnitude (global diplomatic breakdown) and probability (inevitable retaliation based on reciprocity)\n- PRO asserts impacts but doesn't effectively weigh why accountability outweighs diplomatic stability risks\n\n**Clash Effectiveness:**\n- CON directly addresses PRO's official/personal distinction as \"dangerous and unworkable\"\n- CON challenges PRO's dismissal of Vienna Convention as \"profound misunderstanding\"\n- PRO's rebuttals are more assertive than substantive (calling arguments \"unfounded\" without detailed refutation)\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:** CON presents more internally consistent logic about how subjective interpretations would create problems. PRO's distinction between official/personal acts is proposed but not fully developed against CON's challenges.\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:** Both sides rely primarily on reasoning rather than specific examples. PRO mentions crimes but doesn't provide detailed cases. CON grounds arguments in Vienna Convention framework.\n\n**Clash:** CON more directly engages PRO's specific proposals (official/personal distinction, Vienna Convention dismissal). PRO makes broader assertions about CON's arguments being \"flawed\" without detailed engagement.\n\n**Weighing:** CON provides clearer comparative analysis of impacts (stability vs. accountability, immediate vs. speculative). PRO asserts impacts \"far outweigh risks\" but doesn't develop the comparison.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior clash and impact weighing.
