  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Essential skills for future job market (13% growth in tech jobs)\n2. Cognitive development (critical thinking, problem-solving)\n3. Creativity and innovation through programming\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Curriculum overload and resource strain\n2. Developmental inappropriateness for young children\n3. Educational inequality concerns\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- CON directly challenged PRO's curriculum integration claim, arguing mandatory subjects require dedicated time\n- PRO responded with interdisciplinary approaches and examples (Finland, Singapore)\n- CON countered that interdisciplinary approaches often mean \"superficial integration\"\n- On developmental appropriateness, PRO cited ScratchJr; CON distinguished between computational thinking tools and \"formal programming\"\n- On inequality, PRO claimed mandating creates equity; CON argued this ignores resource realities\n\n## Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n\nPRO: The cognitive development and future skills argument remains partially intact, supported by the UC study and job growth statistics.\n\nCON: The curriculum overload and resource strain argument remains strong, as PRO never adequately addressed where the time/resources would come from. CON's distinction between computational thinking tools and formal programming also stands largely unrefuted.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- CON provided clearer comparative weighing by explaining immediate, concrete harms (curriculum dilution, resource strain, inequality exacerbation)\n- PRO focused on future benefits but didn't effectively weigh against CON's present-day implementation concerns\n- CON's timeframe argument (immediate implementation problems vs. future benefits) was more developed\n\n## Scoring\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear structure, coherent claims)\n- CON: 4 (Well-organized, logical progression)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 3 (BLS statistics, UC study, but limited concrete implementation details)\n- CON: 3 (Logical reasoning about resources, but fewer hard citations)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 3 (Engaged with concerns but responses were somewhat surface-level)\n- CON: 4 (Directly addressed PRO's rebuttals, made clear distinctions)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 2 (Focused on benefits but didn't comparatively weigh against costs)\n- CON: 4 (Clear comparative analysis of immediate harms vs. future benefits, timeframe considerations)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing and more effective clash.
