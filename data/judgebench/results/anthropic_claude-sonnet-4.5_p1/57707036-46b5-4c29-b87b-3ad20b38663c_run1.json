  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Nationalism fosters division (US/UK polarization, xenophobia)\n2. Nationalism enables authoritarianism (Orb\u00e1n in Hungary)\n3. Nationalism undermines global cooperation (COVID-19 response)\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Nationalism can unify nations (post-WWII US civil rights)\n2. Nationalism supports democratic sovereignty (doesn't inherently lead to authoritarianism)\n3. Nationalism can coexist with global cooperation (EU example)\n\n**After Clash:**\n- PRO effectively countered CON's post-WWII example by citing McCarthyism\n- CON acknowledged manipulation of nationalism but argued it's not inherent to nationalism itself\n- PRO's COVID-19 example remained largely unrefuted\n- CON's EU example remained largely unaddressed by PRO\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's strongest surviving argument:** Nationalism's practical manifestation in modern politics (Orb\u00e1n, COVID-19 hoarding) demonstrates destructive outcomes with concrete contemporary examples.\n\n**CON's strongest surviving argument:** Nationalism's destructiveness depends on implementation, not inherent nature; EU demonstrates constructive nationalism is possible.\n\n**Critical Distinction:** PRO argues about nationalism \"as practiced\" in modern politics; CON argues about nationalism's theoretical potential when \"properly balanced.\"\n\nThe resolution asks about nationalism in \"modern politics\" - PRO's focus on current practical manifestations is more directly responsive. CON's theoretical defense doesn't adequately address why modern manifestations are predominantly destructive.\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear, consistent focus on modern examples (4)\n- CON: Coherent but relies on theoretical distinctions and historical examples less relevant to \"modern politics\" (3)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Specific contemporary examples (Orb\u00e1n, COVID-19, US/UK polarization) (4)\n- CON: Mixed - EU is relevant, post-WWII less so for \"modern politics\" (3)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly engaged CON's examples, countered with McCarthyism, addressed manipulation argument (4)\n- CON: Acknowledged PRO's points but primarily argued \"not inherent\" without fully addressing modern prevalence (3)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clear comparative weighing in summary - division, authoritarianism, global cooperation failures (4)\n- CON: Some weighing but primarily defensive, less comparative analysis (3)\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nPRO more effectively demonstrated that nationalism functions destructively in modern politics through contemporary examples. CON's \"when properly balanced\" defense concedes that modern nationalism often isn't properly balanced, which supports PRO's position about its actual role in modern politics.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.72,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won by focusing on nationalism's actual manifestation in modern politics with contemporary examples (Orb\u00e1n, COVID-19, polarization).
