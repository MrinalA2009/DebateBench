  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically through multiple passes to ensure stability.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Irreversible biodiversity destruction with century-to-millennium recovery times (supported by Science Advances 2020)\n2. Sediment plumes spreading hundreds of kilometers with transboundary impacts\n3. Precautionary principle given scientific uncertainty\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Critical minerals needed for renewable energy transition (IEA support)\n2. ISA regulatory framework exists and is evolving\n3. Phased approach allows monitoring while extracting resources\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO effectively challenged CON's regulatory optimism by emphasizing irreversibility and questioning framework effectiveness\n- CON countered with World Bank study claiming deep-sea mining could be more environmentally friendly than land-based mining\n- PRO's recycling/circular economy alternative was not directly refuted by CON\n- CON's claim that prohibition would drive industry \"into shadows\" was not addressed by PRO\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Permanent ecosystem destruction, species extinction, disruption of global nutrient cycling/carbon sequestration\n- CON: Access to minerals for renewable energy, reduced land-based mining impacts\n\nPRO provided clearer magnitude (irreversible, millennial timescales) and scope (transboundary, global ecosystem services). CON's impacts are more speculative (future mineral needs, unproven comparative environmental benefits).\n\n## Scoring Assessment\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure, consistent logic about irreversibility (5)\n- CON: Coherent but relies on future promises over current evidence (4)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Science Advances study, specific mechanisms (sediment plumes, recovery times) (5)\n- CON: IEA and World Bank citations but less specific application (4)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addressed regulations, mineral needs, challenged effectiveness (5)\n- CON: Engaged but didn't adequately answer irreversibility concern (3)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Clear comparative weighing (permanent vs. temporary, ecosystem vs. minerals) (5)\n- CON: Some weighing but didn't effectively compare timeframes or reversibility (3)\n\n## Decision\n\nPRO's argument about irreversible harm with millennial recovery times survived CON's regulatory framework response because CON never adequately addressed how regulations could prevent permanent damage to slow-recovering ecosystems. PRO's precautionary principle framing, combined with concrete evidence about recovery timescales, outweighs CON's speculative benefits from unproven regulatory frameworks.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won by establishing irreversible harm with millennial recovery timescales that CON's evolving regulations cannot adequately prevent.
