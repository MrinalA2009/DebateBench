  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n**Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis:**\n\nPRO's strongest remaining argument: Diplomatic immunity creates impunity for serious crimes (trafficking, assault, espionage) and limiting it would promote accountability while distinguishing between official and personal acts.\n\nCON's strongest remaining argument: Diplomatic immunity is essential for functioning diplomacy per the Vienna Convention; limiting it would create subjective interpretations leading to politically motivated harassment and reciprocal retaliation cycles.\n\n**Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO argues for accountability but provides no specific evidence of abuse cases, no mechanism for how the official/personal distinction would work, and doesn't adequately respond to CON's concerns about subjective interpretation. PRO repeatedly asserts that \"most diplomats already respect local laws\" but this undercuts their own argument about widespread abuse.\n\nCON provides a clearer mechanism (Vienna Convention framework), explains existing accountability measures (waivers, persona non grata), and demonstrates concrete harms from limitation (politically motivated prosecution, retaliation cycles, disrupted diplomatic channels). CON effectively challenges PRO's official/personal distinction as unworkable and subjective.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n\nPRO: Speculative benefits of increased accountability for unspecified abuses\nCON: Immediate, concrete risks to diplomatic function, international stability, and peaceful conflict resolution\n\nCON's impacts are more clearly articulated with higher probability (reciprocity is established practice in international relations) and greater magnitude (destabilization of entire diplomatic system vs. addressing rare abuses through existing mechanisms).\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n\nCON directly engages PRO's distinction argument and demonstrates its fatal flaw (subjectivity). PRO largely reasserts positions without addressing CON's Vienna Convention defense or the retaliation concern substantively. CON's point about reciprocity in international relations goes largely unrefuted.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by effectively defending the Vienna Convention framework and demonstrating that PRO's official/personal distinction is unworkably subjective. CON's impacts (diplomatic destabilization, retaliation cycles) are more concrete and probable than PRO's speculative accountability benefits.
