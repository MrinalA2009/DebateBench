  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Accessibility for rural/underserved areas (50% increase claim)\n2. Efficiency gains (half the time for visits)\n3. Patient satisfaction (76% satisfaction rate)\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Diagnostic accuracy concerns (75% of diagnoses require physical examination)\n2. Patient-doctor relationship quality\n3. Comprehensive care limitations\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO acknowledges telemedicine isn't for all cases but argues it's effective for routine visits where physical exams aren't critical\n- CON counters that \"unexpected findings\" in routine visits require physical examination (75% statistic)\n- PRO proposes hybrid model; CON argues this concedes telemedicine's limitations\n- Both sides engage but neither fully resolves the core tension\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Key Weighing Factors:**\n\nPRO's impact weighing focuses on:\n- Magnitude: Millions gaining access to care\n- Scope: Broad population benefit\n- Timeframe: Immediate efficiency gains\n\nCON's impact weighing focuses on:\n- Magnitude: Misdiagnosis risks affecting patient safety\n- Probability: 75% of diagnoses require physical exam\n- Reversibility: Compromised care quality\n\n**Critical Observation:**\nCON's 75% statistic (diagnoses based on physical examination) directly undermines PRO's claim that telemedicine is suitable for \"most routine visits.\" PRO never adequately refutes this specific evidence. PRO's rebuttal that \"many conditions\" can be managed remotely doesn't address whether \"most\" can be.\n\nCON effectively argues that PRO's hybrid model concession undermines the resolution itself (replacing \"most\" visits). PRO's final summary acknowledges telemedicine as \"enhancement\" rather than replacement, which appears to concede ground on the resolution's core claim.\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:** CON maintains more consistent logical structure; PRO's shift from \"replacement\" to \"enhancement\" creates internal tension.\n\n**Evidence:** Both cite studies, but CON's 75% physical examination statistic is more directly relevant to the resolution's scope (\"most visits\").\n\n**Clash:** Both engage substantively. CON more effectively exploits PRO's concessions about limitations.\n\n**Weighing:** CON frames the debate as quality vs. convenience and argues quality should prevail. PRO emphasizes access but doesn't adequately weigh against diagnostic accuracy risks for the majority of visits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by effectively challenging the scope of the resolution. The 75% physical examination statistic undermines PRO's claim that telemedicine can replace 'most' routine visits. PRO's concession to a hybrid model and framing telemedicine as 'enhancement' rather than 'replacement' weakens their position on the resolution. CON successfully weighs diagnostic accuracy risks against convenience benefits.\"\n}\n```",
