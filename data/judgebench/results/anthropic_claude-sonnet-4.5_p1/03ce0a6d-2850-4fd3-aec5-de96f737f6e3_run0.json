  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically through multiple passes to ensure stability.\n\n**First Pass Analysis:**\n\n**Stage 1 - Argument Survival:**\n\nPRO's strongest remaining arguments:\n- Historical precedent shows resource ownership leads to conflict (scramble for Africa, resource wars)\n- Ownership would exacerbate global inequality (only wealthy nations/corporations could participate)\n- Profit motives override environmental concerns; space's vastness makes oversight impossible\n\nCON's strongest remaining arguments:\n- Ownership incentivizes investment and technological advancement\n- Regulated ownership can promote international cooperation through joint agreements\n- Ownership creates stewardship incentives\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\nPRO effectively refuted CON's cooperation argument by citing historical precedent and the Outer Space Treaty's purpose. CON's rebuttal actually echoed PRO's arguments about conflict and inequality, appearing to concede these points rather than defend their position. This is a critical error - CON's rebuttal reads more like a PRO speech.\n\n**Stage 2 - Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO provided concrete historical examples (scramble for Africa, resource wars) and explained mechanisms (wealth barriers, profit motives, enforcement difficulties). CON offered theoretical benefits but failed to address PRO's historical evidence or explain how their system would avoid past failures.\n\nThe inequality impact is particularly strong and unrefuted - CON never adequately responded to the barrier-to-entry argument.\n\n**Second Pass Verification:**\n\nReviewing CON's rebuttal again - it appears CON made a significant strategic error by arguing PRO's points. The rebuttal states \"the potential for conflict, inequality, and environmental degradation far outweighs any hypothetical benefits of ownership\" - this is literally PRO's position.\n\nThis substantially weakens CON's overall performance as they failed to defend their constructive arguments and instead reinforced PRO's case.\n\n**Third Pass - Score Calibration:**\n\nPRO: Consistent argumentation, strong historical grounding, effective refutation\nCON: Initial arguments had merit, but catastrophic rebuttal error, failed to defend position\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 5,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won decisively through historical evidence showing ownership breeds conflict and inequality. CON's critical error in their rebuttal\u2014arguing PRO's position that 'conflict, inequality, and degradation outweigh benefits of ownership'\u2014effectively conceded the debate. PRO's unrefuted arguments about wealth barriers and enforcement difficulties in space, supported by concrete examples like the scramble for Africa, proved more compelling than CON's theoretical cooperation model.\"\n}\n```",
