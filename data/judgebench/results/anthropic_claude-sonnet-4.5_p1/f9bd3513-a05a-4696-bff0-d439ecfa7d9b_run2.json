  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n**Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis:**\n\nPRO's strongest remaining arguments:\n- Cost-effectiveness of social services ($1 spent on mental health saves $4 in criminal justice costs)\n- Mental health professionals better equipped than police for crisis response\n- Over-policing exacerbates community tensions\n\nCON's strongest remaining arguments:\n- Community policing initiatives build trust and reduce crime\n- Police provide immediate safety/stabilization as first responders\n- Balanced approach (reform + funding both) more effective than defunding\n\n**Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO provided specific evidence (National Institute of Justice study, Treatment Advocacy Center report) supporting their claims about cost-effectiveness and crisis response. However, they didn't adequately address CON's point about immediate safety needs or explain the transition mechanism.\n\nCON effectively challenged PRO's causal claims about over-policing causing crime and highlighted the complexity of implementation. However, CON relied more on general assertions about police training and reform without specific evidence to counter PRO's cost-effectiveness data.\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\nBoth sides engaged directly. PRO addressed police training concerns but didn't fully resolve the first responder safety gap. CON challenged PRO's oversimplification but didn't provide counter-evidence to PRO's cost-effectiveness claims.\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\nPRO emphasized magnitude (cost savings, systemic inequality). CON emphasized probability/immediacy (public safety risks). Neither side provided clear comparative weighing of these competing impacts.\n\n**Decision:**\nPRO wins narrowly. While CON raised valid concerns about implementation and immediate safety, PRO provided more concrete evidence for their claims and established a clearer causal mechanism between funding reallocation and crime reduction. CON's arguments about reform were reasonable but less substantiated with specific evidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.55,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins narrowly on evidence strength.
