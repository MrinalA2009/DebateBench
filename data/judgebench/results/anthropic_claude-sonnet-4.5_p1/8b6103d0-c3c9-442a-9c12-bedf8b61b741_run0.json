  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically through multiple passes to ensure stability.\n\n**First Pass Analysis:**\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Presents clear thesis about systemic issues in policing and provides concrete example (CAHOOTS). Arguments are coherent and logically structured. Score: 4\n- CON: Presents clear counter-arguments about public safety necessity and provides Minneapolis example. Well-structured but somewhat reactive. Score: 4\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: Uses CAHOOTS program as specific evidence, references studies about police budget allocation, provides mechanism for how reallocation works. Score: 4\n- CON: Cites Minneapolis crime surge, but acknowledges complexity. Less specific evidence than PRO. Score: 3\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Directly addresses Minneapolis example, challenges CON's claims about social services lacking response capability, engages with the \"balanced approach\" argument. Score: 4\n- CON: Responds to PRO's arguments but somewhat defensively. Acknowledges Eugene model but doesn't fully refute it, instead noting it maintains some police presence. Score: 3\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Frames debate around root causes vs. symptoms, argues limited resources require prioritization, emphasizes systemic racism and community trust. Score: 4\n- CON: Focuses on immediate safety concerns and crime rates, but less comparative weighing of why their impacts outweigh PRO's. Score: 3\n\n**Second Pass - Argument Survival:**\n\nPRO's strongest surviving argument: Alternative response models (CAHOOTS) can effectively handle many situations currently handled by police, addressing root causes while improving community trust. CON acknowledges these models exist but doesn't eliminate this argument\u2014only notes they maintain some police presence.\n\nCON's strongest surviving argument: Complete defunding risks public safety in violent/dangerous situations requiring immediate law enforcement response. PRO challenges this by noting many crises don't require police, but doesn't fully eliminate the concern about violent emergencies.\n\n**Third Pass - Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO provides more specific evidence (CAHOOTS) and better engages with CON's arguments. PRO's rebuttal effectively contextualizes the Minneapolis example and challenges the necessity of police for all crises. CON's argument about maintaining police for violent situations survives but is narrower in scope than PRO's systemic reform argument.\n\nThe key clash is whether reallocation addresses root causes (PRO) vs. whether it risks immediate safety (CON). PRO better weighs this by arguing limited resources require prioritization and that current system is inefficient, while CON's weighing focuses mainly on crime deterrence without fully engaging the efficiency argument.\n\n**Stability Check:** Across all three passes, PRO consistently demonstrates stronger evidence integration, more effective clash, and clearer impact weighing. The decision is stable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through stronger evidence integration (CAHOOTS program), more effective engagement with CON's arguments (contextualizing Minneapolis, challenging police necessity for all crises), and clearer impact weighing on root causes versus symptoms.
