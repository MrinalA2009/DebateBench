  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n- Restorative justice framework with empirical support (victim satisfaction, closure, healing)\n- Victim impact statements as existing, functional tools\n- Structured programs can balance victim input with legal standards\n- Sentencing occurs post-guilt, so doesn't violate \"innocent until proven guilty\"\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n- Emotional victim input leads to inconsistent, biased sentencing\n- Compromises judicial objectivity and impartiality\n- Shifts focus from systemic goals (deterrence, rehabilitation) to individual grievances\n- Creates punitive environment driven by vengeance rather than justice\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO addresses the \"innocent until proven guilty\" concern effectively by noting sentencing is post-conviction\n- CON counters PRO's \"structured programs\" claim by arguing judges remain susceptible to emotional influence\n- PRO provides empirical grounding (studies on satisfaction, recidivism); CON relies more on logical concerns about bias\n- CON doesn't effectively refute PRO's evidence on reduced recidivism and victim satisfaction\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Healing, closure, reduced recidivism, more effective rehabilitation (concrete, measurable outcomes)\n- CON: Risk of bias, inconsistency, erosion of fairness (theoretical concerns without empirical support)\n\nPRO's impacts are more concrete and supported by evidence. CON's concerns about bias are logical but remain theoretical - they don't provide evidence that structured victim input programs actually lead to the harms claimed.\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:** PRO 4, CON 4 - Both presented clear, logical arguments\n**Evidence:** PRO 4, CON 2 - PRO cited studies and empirical support; CON relied on logical assertions\n**Clash:** PRO 4, CON 3 - PRO directly addressed key objections; CON engaged but less effectively\n**Weighing:** PRO 4, CON 3 - PRO compared concrete benefits vs theoretical risks; CON focused on principles without comparative analysis\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO won through superior evidence and weighing. While CON raised valid concerns about bias and objectivity, PRO provided empirical support for victim satisfaction and reduced recidivism, effectively rebutted the 'innocent until proven guilty' objection, and demonstrated that structured programs can balance victim input with legal standards. CON's arguments remained largely theoretical without evidentiary support for claimed harms.\"\n}\n```",
