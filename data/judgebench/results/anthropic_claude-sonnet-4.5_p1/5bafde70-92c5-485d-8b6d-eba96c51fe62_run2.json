  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Tipping perpetuates bias against marginalized workers (women, people of color receive lower tips)\n2. Higher wages provide economic stability and reduce poverty among service workers\n3. Stable wages lead to lower turnover and reduced training costs for businesses\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Tipping allows skilled workers to earn more than flat wages (Cornell study cited)\n2. Tipping provides consumer accountability mechanism for service quality\n3. Higher wage mandates create economic burden on small businesses\n\n**After Clash:**\n- PRO's bias argument remains strong; CON acknowledges bias exists but doesn't refute that tipping perpetuates it\n- CON's earning potential argument is weakened by PRO's point about disparities, though not eliminated\n- CON's accountability argument stands but is contested by PRO's claim about transactional relationships\n- PRO's turnover cost argument is partially refuted by CON's short-term burden concern\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**PRO's Impact:** Systemic fairness for marginalized workers, economic stability reducing poverty\n**CON's Impact:** Preserving earning potential for high performers, maintaining consumer choice, protecting small businesses\n\n**Weighing Analysis:**\n- PRO emphasizes magnitude (affects all workers, particularly marginalized groups) and scope (systemic change)\n- CON emphasizes probability (immediate economic harm to businesses) and preserves existing benefits\n- PRO provides clearer comparative weighing of why fairness outweighs earning potential for top performers\n- CON's business burden argument is strong but less developed in terms of comparative impact\n\n## Scoring Assessment\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear, coherent structure with three distinct claims)\n- CON: 4 (Well-organized with three clear arguments)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 3 (References Economic Policy Institute, general research on bias, but limited specific data)\n- CON: 4 (Cornell study cited specifically, concrete mechanisms explained)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 4 (Directly addresses earning potential, accountability, and business burden arguments)\n- CON: 3 (Engages with bias and service quality but less effectively counters the fairness argument)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear comparative weighing: fairness and stability vs. earning potential)\n- CON: 3 (Some weighing but less explicit comparison of why their impacts outweigh PRO's)\n\nPRO wins on superior impact weighing and more effective engagement with the core fairness argument. While CON presented strong arguments about earning potential and business concerns, they didn't adequately weigh why preserving the current system's benefits outweighs the systemic inequities PRO identified. PRO's consistent focus on marginalized workers and comparative analysis proved more decisive.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.65,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins through superior impact weighing and clash.
