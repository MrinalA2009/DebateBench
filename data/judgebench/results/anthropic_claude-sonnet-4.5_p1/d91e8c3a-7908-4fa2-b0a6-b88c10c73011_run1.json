  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Accessibility for rural/underserved areas (50% increase claim)\n2. Efficiency gains (half the time for visits)\n3. Patient satisfaction (76% satisfaction rate)\n\n**CON's Strongest Arguments:**\n1. Diagnostic accuracy concerns (75% of diagnoses require physical examination)\n2. Patient-doctor relationship quality\n3. Comprehensive care limitations\n\n**Clash Analysis:**\n- PRO's accessibility argument remains largely uncontested by CON\n- CON's diagnostic accuracy claim (75% statistic) is partially addressed by PRO but not fully refuted\n- Both sides engage on patient-doctor relationships, with CON emphasizing quality over frequency\n- PRO's efficiency argument stands with minimal direct refutation\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO emphasizes magnitude (millions gaining access) and probability (documented satisfaction rates)\n- CON emphasizes magnitude of risk (misdiagnosis, patient safety) and irreversibility (health outcomes)\n- CON's 75% diagnostic statistic is more directly impactful than PRO's efficiency claims\n- PRO's accessibility argument affects scope but CON's safety concerns affect severity\n\n**Critical Factors:**\n1. CON effectively challenges PRO's core premise by showing physical examinations are essential for most diagnoses (75% statistic)\n2. PRO's rebuttal acknowledges telemedicine works for \"routine consultations where physical examinations are not critical\" - this concedes ground\n3. CON maintains that replacing \"most\" visits is problematic, even if some visits could be virtual\n4. PRO's final position shifts toward \"enhancement\" rather than \"replacement,\" weakening their affirmation of the resolution\n\n## Scoring Rationale\n\n**Argument Quality:** CON maintains internal consistency throughout; PRO shifts from \"replacement\" to \"enhancement\"\n**Evidence:** Both provide statistics; CON's 75% figure directly challenges the resolution's feasibility\n**Clash:** CON directly engages PRO's claims; PRO partially concedes by acknowledging limitations\n**Weighing:** CON frames safety vs. convenience more effectively; PRO focuses on access but doesn't adequately weigh against diagnostic risks\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins by effectively challenging the resolution's feasibility with the 75% diagnostic statistic, forcing PRO to concede telemedicine works only where physical exams aren't critical. PRO's shift from 'replacement' to 'enhancement' undermines their affirmation. CON's safety-versus-convenience framing proved more decisive than PRO's accessibility benefits, particularly when PRO couldn't adequately refute that most diagnoses require physical examination.\"\n}\n```",
