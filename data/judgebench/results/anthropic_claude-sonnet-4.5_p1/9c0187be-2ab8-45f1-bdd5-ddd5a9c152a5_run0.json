  "judgment": "I'll evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Strongest Remaining Argument:**\nCultural commodification and erosion through unrestricted tourism, with sovereign right to implement restrictions as necessary protective measures. PRO effectively uses examples (Maasai, Venice) and argues that the \"right to restrict\" enables sustainable practices.\n\n**CON's Strongest Remaining Argument:**\nSustainable tourism practices can balance economic benefits with cultural preservation without broad restrictions. CON argues that education and managed tourism (citing Japan, Bhutan) achieve protection without restricting access.\n\n**Key Clash Point:**\nBoth sides actually cite similar examples (Japan, Bhutan) but interpret them differently. PRO claims these nations use restrictions to succeed; CON claims they use sustainable practices without broad restrictions. PRO's rebuttal effectively points out that CON's examples actually support the resolution since those nations DO employ restrictions and regulations.\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO emphasizes cultural integrity, authenticity, and sovereign rights with concrete examples of erosion\n- CON emphasizes economic benefits, cross-cultural understanding, and concerns about discrimination\n- PRO more directly addresses the comparative: restrictions ENABLE the sustainable practices CON advocates\n- CON's discrimination argument remains largely unsubstantiated and doesn't clearly outweigh cultural preservation\n\n**Clash Effectiveness:**\nPRO successfully turns CON's examples (Japan/Bhutan) to support their case, noting these countries DO restrict tourism. CON doesn't adequately respond to this turn. PRO also effectively addresses the \"right to restrict\" as enabling sustainable practices, not requiring total bans.\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear, coherent case about sovereign rights and cultural protection)\n- CON: 3 (Reasonable arguments but some internal tension between advocating management while opposing restrictions)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: 4 (Specific examples: Maasai, Venice, with mechanisms explained)\n- CON: 3 (Examples provided but less developed; Japan/Bhutan examples backfire)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: 4 (Directly engages CON's arguments, turns their examples effectively)\n- CON: 3 (Engages but doesn't adequately respond to PRO's turns)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: 4 (Clear comparison: cultural integrity vs. economic benefits; explains why restrictions enable sustainability)\n- CON: 2 (Limited comparative weighing; discrimination concern underdeveloped)\n\n**Winner Determination:**\nPRO wins because they more effectively demonstrated that the \"right to restrict\" enables the sustainable tourism practices CON advocates, successfully turned CON's examples, and provided clearer impact weighing on cultural preservation versus economic benefits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"PRO\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 3\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"PRO wins by effectively turning CON's examples (Japan, Bhutan) to show these nations DO employ restrictions, and by demonstrating that the right to restrict enables the sustainable practices CON advocates.
