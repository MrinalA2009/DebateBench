  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n**Stage 1 \u2014 Argument Survival Analysis:**\n\nPRO's strongest remaining arguments:\n- 16-year-olds already handle significant responsibilities (driving, employment, education decisions)\n- Civic education provides foundational knowledge for informed voting\n- Evidence from Scotland and Austria shows increased youth engagement\n- Cognitive ability to reason and make informed decisions is present at 16\n\nCON's strongest remaining arguments:\n- Full cognitive maturity (impulse control, long-term planning) not reached until mid-20s\n- Adolescents more susceptible to peer influence and emotional decision-making\n- Knowledge from civic education doesn't guarantee informed voting\n- Risk of volatile electoral outcomes from fleeting emotional responses\n\n**Stage 2 \u2014 Comparative Evaluation:**\n\nPRO effectively argues that 16-year-olds possess sufficient maturity through existing responsibilities and education. However, PRO's rebuttal that concerns about emotional decision-making \"apply to voters of all ages\" doesn't adequately address why we should extend voting to a less cognitively mature group.\n\nCON maintains a consistent argument about cognitive development backed by developmental psychology research. CON effectively distinguishes between making personal life decisions and voting in national elections, arguing the latter requires more nuanced understanding. CON's point that increased engagement doesn't equal informed participation directly challenges PRO's evidence from Austria and Scotland.\n\n**Weighing Analysis:**\n\nCON provides clearer impact weighing by emphasizing the integrity of the electoral process and potential for volatile outcomes affecting society as a whole. PRO focuses on individual rights and engagement but doesn't adequately weigh why these benefits outweigh CON's concerns about electoral integrity.\n\nCON's argument about protecting democratic integrity through informed voting has greater magnitude and probability than PRO's engagement benefits, especially since PRO concedes that overall turnout increases weren't dramatic in their own examples.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 4,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing and more effective clash. While PRO establishes that 16-year-olds have some maturity, CON successfully distinguishes personal decisions from electoral participation and demonstrates that cognitive development concerns outweigh engagement benefits. CON's argument about protecting electoral integrity through informed voting carries greater magnitude than PRO's participation benefits, especially since PRO's own evidence showed limited turnout increases.\"\n}\n```",
