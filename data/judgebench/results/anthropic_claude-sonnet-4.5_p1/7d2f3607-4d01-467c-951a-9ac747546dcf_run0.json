  "judgment": "I will evaluate this debate systematically using the required framework.\n\n## Stage 1: Argument Survival Analysis\n\n**PRO's Main Arguments:**\n1. Environmental impact (14x more CO2 per passenger)\n2. Social equity (wealth gap symbolism)\n3. Resource misallocation (could fund public transit)\n\n**CON's Main Arguments:**\n1. Economic damage ($247B industry, 1.2M jobs)\n2. Environmental impact overstated (small fraction of emissions, innovation incentive)\n3. Social equity misguided (doesn't redistribute wealth)\n\n**Clash Assessment:**\n- PRO's environmental argument partially survives but is weakened by CON's point about innovation incentives and relative scale\n- CON's economic argument survives strongly - PRO offers only speculative \"green jobs\" without concrete evidence\n- PRO's social equity argument remains largely symbolic; CON effectively challenges its practical impact\n- CON's innovation argument (SAFs, electric aircraft) goes largely unrefuted by PRO\n\n## Stage 2: Comparative Evaluation\n\n**Strongest Remaining Arguments:**\n- **PRO**: Environmental impact per passenger (14x multiplier)\n- **CON**: Economic devastation (concrete figures: $247B, 1.2M jobs) + innovation incentive removal\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- CON provides specific, immediate economic impacts with quantified harm\n- PRO's environmental impact, while real, is acknowledged by both sides to be a small fraction of total emissions\n- CON's innovation argument creates a double-bind: banning removes funding for the very solutions needed\n- PRO's resource reallocation is speculative without concrete implementation plan\n\n## Scoring Analysis\n\n**Argument Quality:**\n- PRO: Clear structure but relies on symbolic/moral framing (3)\n- CON: Concrete, specific counterarguments with mechanisms (4)\n\n**Evidence & Grounding:**\n- PRO: One specific statistic (14x), rest largely assertion-based (3)\n- CON: Multiple specific figures ($247B, 1.2M jobs, 2.5% aviation emissions) (4)\n\n**Clash & Refutation:**\n- PRO: Addresses economic points but with speculation, doesn't engage innovation argument (3)\n- CON: Directly refutes each PRO point with specific counterarguments (4)\n\n**Impact Weighing:**\n- PRO: Asserts importance but doesn't comparatively weigh against economic harm (2)\n- CON: Explicitly weighs immediate economic harm vs. negligible environmental impact, addresses timeframe (4)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winner\": \"CON\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"argument_quality\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"clash\": {\n      \"PRO\": 3,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    },\n    \"weighing\": {\n      \"PRO\": 2,\n      \"CON\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"short_reason\": \"CON wins through superior impact weighing and evidence. CON provided concrete economic figures ($247B, 1.2M jobs) showing immediate, quantifiable harm, while effectively arguing private jets represent negligible emissions. PRO's environmental argument, though valid, lacked comparative weighing against economic impacts. CON's innovation incentive argument went largely unrefuted, creating a strategic double-bind that undermined PRO's environmental case.\"\n}\n```",
